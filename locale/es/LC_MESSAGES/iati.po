Over the course of 2018, five organizations will trial using the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard to share data with OCHA\\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS).</p><p>This work is in support of the <a href=\\\"https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/grand-bargain-hosted-iasc\\\">Grand Bargain</a>, an agreement between over 50 of the largest donors and aid agencies, which includes commitments on greater financial transparency and more harmonised and simplified reporting requirements. IATI has been identified as the international standard for publishing open data on humanitarian aid and FTS as the platform for reporting how humanitarian funding is allocated and used.</p><p>The latest version of the IATI Standard, released in February 2018, (<a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/news/iati-upgrade-to-version-2-03-goes-live\\\">version 2.03</a>) enables organisations to publish more granular data on their humanitarian activities, such as earmarked funding, pledges, humanitarian clusters and cash transfers, and whether funding is channelled via local and national responders. Over <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/news/700-organisations-have-published-iati-data\\\">750 humanitarian and development organisations</a> currently publish their data using the IATI Standard.</p><p>FTS monitors the funding progress against humanitarian response plans and appeals which amounted to $25 billion in 2018 alone. Reporting to FTS is voluntary, and as a result, the service does not always have a complete picture. The majority of organisations provide funding data to FTS through manual, often ad-hoc processes. Since many organisations already publish data on development spending via IATI, use of the standard for humanitarian spending will reduce duplicate reporting and create internal efficiencies and cost savings.</p><p>Current participants for the pilot include the International Rescue Committee, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, OCHA\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://www.unocha.org/our-work/humanitarian-financing/country-based-pooled-funds-cbpfs\\\">Country-based Pooled Funds</a>, the UK Department for International Development, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</p><p>The pilot includes the following components:</p><ul><li>Support to pilot partners to modify their existing financial and activity reporting systems (or creating new ones).</li><li>Integrating the new reporting streams into FTS, and testing FTS\\u2019s recently-developed IATI ingestion module.</li><li>Developing technical guidelines for reporting humanitarian funding to FTS using IATI.</li><li>Training and outreach events, including an IATI-FTS technical meeting with partners.</li></ul><p>After the pilot period, we will continue to support organisations to use IATI for FTS reporting, in line with IATI\\u2019s \\u2018publish once, use often\\u2019 approach. The long-term goal is for the majority of organisations to use IATI to report on both their development and humanitarian spending.</p><p>We look forward to sharing lessons, experiences and updates in the coming months, and to connect with other organisations that might be interested in participating. To learn more or join the next phase of the project, please contact Eleonore Fournier-Tombs, IATI Technical Specialist with OCHA\\u2019s Centre for Humanitarian Data: <a href=\\\"mailto:centrehumdata@un.org\\\">centrehumdata@un.org</a>.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

The government of Nepal, supported by development partners, has established the Aid Management Platform (AMP) and launched its public website. Several other platforms and initiatives have been put in place by various actors with the aim of providing aid-related and humanitarian information, in particular following the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. This reflects a growing demand for increased production, sharing and use of data to meet development aims, as well as improved transparency and accountability.Internationally, there has also been an increase in the availability and quality of data. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) now has more than 600 bilateral, multilateral, non-government and private sector development partners publishing data to its standard. The Data Revolution has brought the role of data in meeting and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to the fore. What is less clear, is the extent to which aid data is being used, by whom and for what purpose, and it is this that the discussion paper seeks to investigate for the specific case of aid information use in one country.This discussion paper highlights information needs of different stakeholder groups to assist user-centred approaches to providing data on aid finance, considers the potential role of data published to the IATI Standard in this context, and builds interest in increased use of data on aid finance among key stakeholder groups.</p><h2><b>Key findings</b></h2><ul><li>Many stakeholders share common interests and needs with regard to financial information on aid. There is a shared motivation to understand how aid is allocated, spent and what results it contributes to.</li><li>There is a demand for more analytical information, in particular on needs, resources and results of development interventions; aid in relation to national SDGs and other indicators; and aid in relation to domestic resources.</li><li>Despite the increase in availability of aid data from national and international sources and platforms, in practice stakeholders rely strongly on written reports, organisational websites and their interpersonal networks to access and use the information they need.</li><li>Greater efforts are needed to increase the awareness of aid data availability from the AMP and IATI, and to engage proactively with different user groups and intermediaries who can support the translation of data into actionable analysis. Ideally this would build on existing information and communication preferences, and coordination fora to enhance these with better data and analysis.</li><li>For this, openness of aid data and its interoperability with other sources of official and administrative data is critical.</li></ul><p></p><embed alt=\\\"Nepal Aid Data\\\" embedtype=\\\"image\\\" format=\\\"left\\\" id=\\\"105\\\"/><p><i>This discussion paper was co-authored by Conrad Zellmann of DI and Kishor Pradhan, an independent consultant.

This has exposed me to an enormous amount of discovery research and User Experience (UX) thinking, that I otherwise may not have the opportunity to delve into.</p><p>We are working with UX agency <em>fffunction</em> for product design and digital agency The Happy Seven for content development to deliver a website that better describes IATI, with content that is easy to locate and navigate.</p><p>The Technical Team recognises that IATI\\u2019s Guidance section has left some users feeling unclear about how to publish their data. The new website is seeking to solve problems such as this.</p><p><strong>Discovery</strong><br/>\\nThe website journey started last year with extensive discovery work about IATI, including 100+ interviews, usability testing and focus groups. The UX agency <em>fffunction</em>, has been brilliant at consolidating this work into user personas. These are a set of profiles to ensure we understand who each of our key users are, and what they are trying to achieve when they visit the IATI website.</p><p>We have created 10 key personas, which may sound like quite a lot, but the IATI community emcompasses a wide range of stakeholders. A core part of the persona work has been to establish the difficulties, or pain points experienced, that need to be overcome in the new site.</p><p><strong>User journeys</strong><br/>\\nFor the next stage of the project, the personas were used to create specific journeys that different people want to take through the website. This resulted in 28 stories like the one below.</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6151\\\" height=\\\"1122\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1586px) 100vw, 1586px\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/IATI-User-Journeys-MA.original.png\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/IATI-User-Journeys-MA.original.png 1586w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IATI-User-Journeys-MA-450x318.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IATI-User-Journeys-MA-768x543.png 768w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IATI-User-Journeys-MA-600x424.png 600w\\\" width=\\\"1586\\\"/></p><p><strong>Information Architecture</strong><br/>\\nOur detailed user journeys are being used to create the new site\\u2019s Information Architecture (IA) (structure and arrangement of content).

A user would expect these projects to be included when searching \\u201call projects in country A\\u201d through a map. However, visualising such projects on a map in an intuitive manner can be a challenge.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There are some basic dos and don\\u2019ts for designating national-level projects in the IATI standard \\u2013 spelled out in IATI\\u2019s guidance \\u2013 that most parties more or less agree on. The country where development projects (referred to as \\u201cactivities\\u201d in the IATI Standard) take place should always be input in IATI\\u2019s \\u201c</span><a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/recipient-country/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Recipient Country</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\\u201d field. The \\u201c</span><a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/activity-scope/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Activity Scope</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\\u201d field should be used to denote that a project is being implemented at the \\u201c</span><a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/activity-scope/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">National level</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.\\u201d However, there was a question on whether publishers should also list the country and its coordinates in the </span><a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/location/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Location</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> section of the standard. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">IATI guidance clearly states that the \\u201cLocation\\u201d field is for \\u201c</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">the sub-national geographical identification of the target locations of an activity\\u2026\\u201d This suggests that national level information should not be added here. However, some organisations expressed concern that their scores on indices such as the </span><a href=\\\"http://ati.publishwhatyoufund.org/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Aid Transparency Index</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> would be dinged for leaving this information out, and thus decided to enter centroid coordinates for the entire country in the \\u201cLocation\\u201d field. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Why does all this matter? When tools are created to visualise IATI location data, if these complexities are not considered, data can be misrepresented. For example, if centroid points for national level projects are entered without clearly indicating that they represent a national level project, it can seem like there are a large number of projects taking place in the middle of the country when that isn\\u2019t really the case. Many suggested that when representing data on maps, national activities (be they general budget support, policy interventions, etc.), should be considered wholly separate from activities that happen in or benefit specific areas \\u201con the ground,\\u201d but again, the risk is that not visualising national level activities drastically understates the story of aid in that country.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Perhaps the challenge can best be represented by a simplistic thought exercise:</span></p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 30px;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Pretend you\\u2019re working in country X, region Y, district Z (in other words, X contains Y, and Y contains Z). </span></i></span></p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 30px;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There is one national-level policy-based initiative being implemented in country X, a health program occurring throughout region Y, and a small capacity-building project happening in district Z. </span></i></span></p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 30px;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">How many projects are being implemented in district Z? </span></i></span></p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 30px;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><em>A) 1</em></span><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><em> B) 2</em></span><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><em> C) 3</em></span><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><em> D) It depends\\u2026</em></span></p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 30px;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #999999;\\\"><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In addition, a fourth project is training teachers from region Y in the main city of a neighboring region, call it region W.

With the addition of the </span><a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/location/location-id/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">GeoID</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, locations that are administrative divisions, and perhaps better represented by the shape/polygon of the admin location, can be linked back to the polygon rather than entering latitude and longitude. However, IATI does not itself store the polygons. This means that the developers of the visualisation platform have to not only perform this linking on their end, but also find an appropriate source to use for importing shapefiles (for instance, </span><a href=\\\"http://www.gadm.org/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">GADM</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">).</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">However, for projects </span><b><i>coded </i></b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">at an Admin level, there still remains the question of whether admin levels should be </span><b><i>displayed </i></b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">as points or as polygons when developing GIS tools. The discussion resulted in agreement that it depends on the purpose of the tool, but no matter what, locations should be clearly labeled with the level (Geographic Class) to which they are coded. For example, users should be able to either select between geographic class, or classes should be differentiated by different shapes, colors, or other visual clues. Highlighting polygons makes it clear that project activities benefit or take place throughout the admin level, however, this can limit the ability to layer it with other types of contextual data, such as fertility, malnutrition, or poverty rates, all of which are frequently represented as shades of color within a polygon.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"color: #b6c400;\\\"><b>Matching Results to Locations</b></span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It was noted that the standard does not currently allow results to be linked to locations, so we\\u2019re unable to disaggregate indicators geographically. That may be forgivable/unnecessary for programs that are implemented more or less uniformly across different areas (i.e. teachers trained in every district within the project area), but it becomes trickier when specific interventions are differentiated by locations (i.e. teachers are trained in some districts, but in others the focus is on other aspects like in-class technology). This is important information for those trying to identify what has taken place at each location and what the results where, instead of inferences being made that might not be correct. On the other hand, this may very well be an edge case that would add further complexity to the IATI standard in order to accomodate.</span></p><p><b>Is it safe to publish locations?</b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Concerns over security were shared if location data could possibly connect to results or other data shared that could have private, sensitive data. It was noted that geocoding activities at a slightly higher level can help avoid these issues. Slightly more technical publishers may wish to consider other methodologies, such as the </span><a href=\\\"https://dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/GPS-Data-Collection.cfm\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">random geographic displacement algorithm</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> that Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) use to obscure the locations of respondents while maintaining a high level of geographic detail.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"color: #b6c400;\\\"><b>What tools are there for producing/publishing location data?</b></span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Some organisations, such as World Bank and UNDP, shared how their internal project management systems allow for project managers to enter location information, and are typically linked to </span><a href=\\\"http://www.geonames.org/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Geonames</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> (an geographic database and gazetteer) to produce the rest of the information needed to publish to IATI. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Development Gateway has also created an Autogeocoder tool that allows for uploading documents that contain location information. The tool reads through the documents and suggests locations for the user to validate or supplement with additional information. The tool has been implemented in the Initiative for Open Ag\\u2019s </span><a href=\\\"http://www.openag.org.uk/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Publisher\\u2019s Toolchain</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, and soon a standalone geocoding tool will be launched which integrates autogeocoding with an existing manual geocoding platform. The tool is open source and will be available for organisations to plug into their own systems or to use the standalone system within their own processes. We are eager to share this tool as soon as it is live!</span></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

The first is the Data Use Task Force, our new working group representing the diverse needs of IATI\\u2019s membership, which will take the lead in driving the implementation and monitoring of action. The second is establishing a new Data Use Fund that will allow experts to bid for funds and deliver specific pieces of work aimed at overcoming identified barriers or solve real-world problems experienced by data users. </span></p><h3><b>What does success look like?</b></h3><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Our final strategy includes a detailed framework to monitor the results of our efforts (Annex I). </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This will be reviewed periodically by the Data Use Task Force (supported by the Secretariat) and an internal evaluation will be carried out after two years.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As a priority, the Data Use Task Force will develop a small number of milestones that are linked to the results framework, that can be achieved by August 2019, which marks the end of IATI\\u2019s current hosting arrangements. </span></p><h3><b>Next steps\\u2026</b></h3><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Now that IATI\\u2019s Data Use Strategy has been approved, the Task Force will be meeting in early January to work on updating the data use elements of the draft budget and workplan (that was presented at the Members\\u2019 Assembly).

This was an ideal opportunity for me to highlight the very important issue of transparency as well as the complementarity between the work of IATI and that of the DAC. From my time as Director-General at Sida, I know first-hand how vital the work of IATI is in enabling aid actors to be accountable both to those who fund them and those who they work for.</p><p>As new global dynamics and challenges emerge, the DAC is reforming itself around six strategic priorities to ensure its ongoing relevance in a changing world:</p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 60px;\\\"><strong>1.\\u00a0</strong>Focus on fostering development impact and mobilising resources.</p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 60px;\\\"><strong>2.</strong> Learn from existing development approaches.</p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 60px;\\\"><strong>3.</strong> Explore new development approaches.</p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 60px;\\\"><strong>4.</strong> Reach out beyond the membership to influence and be influenced.</p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 60px;\\\"><strong>5.</strong> Proactively self-assess and hold ourselves to account.</p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 60px;\\\"><strong>6.</strong> Work in effective governance, systems and structures.</p><p>One of the key areas we\\u2019re keen to connect to is the 2030 Agenda \\u2013 it is critical that contributions to the SDGs are transparent and this is the objective behind the new TOSSD framework (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development). I\\u2019d like to invite all IATI members to <a href=\\\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/tossd-task-force.htm\\\">follow the work of the TOSSD Task Force</a> as we develop the framework, ensure its usefulness for developing countries and undertake consultation in 2018. </p><div class=\\\"perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-right pullquote-border-placement-left\\\"><blockquote><p><span style=\\\"color: #bac200;\\\">\\u201cFrom my time as Director-General at Sida, I know first-hand how vital the work of IATI is in enabling aid actors to be accountable both to those who fund them and those who they work for\\u201d</span></p></blockquote></div><p>We\\u2019re also modernising the definition of ODA (official development assistance) to bring it up to date with changes in the external environment. There will be a revised method for recording loans to the official sector and clarification of both the eligibility of peace and security efforts and the rules on reporting refugee costs in the donor country. We\\u2019ve also worked to improve reporting on the role of private sector instruments (PSI), acknowledging them as part of ODA and increasing transparency on these flows.</p><p>Later this month we will launch this year\\u2019s Development Cooperation Report, with data showing all our members\\u2019 ODA. This year we focus on Data for Development. As you in IATI know well, decision makers understand the value of data but often that data is of poor quality, too complex or hidden in separate systems. We need data to follow up on aid commitments and to be able to see if development cooperation leads to results for people in partner countries.</p><p>However, DAC members do not invest enough in statistical capacity development in partner countries. We need to analyse and communicate all kinds of data better so that it can be used, building alliances between the data and statistics community on the one hand and the advocates and communicators on the other hand.</p><p>So, while we should celebrate progress on transparency, it is crucial that the OECD and IATI Secretariats engage in constant and constructive dialogue to make it as clear and easy as possible for member countries to publish to IATI and report to CRS, and to support efforts to use this data.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

We operate in over 70 countries around the globe and celebrated our 80</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">th</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> birthday this year by launching our new five year strategy \\u2013 </span><a href=\\\"https://plan-international.org/organisation/strategy\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">100 Million Reasons</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.</span></p><p><b>How did Plan International find out about IATI?</b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Five of our national offices \\u2013 Plan International Finland, UK, Ireland, Nederland, and USA have worked with IATI, having published data on the </span><a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">IATI Registry</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. Everyone in the development sector sees IATI as the gold standard on transparency.</span></p><p><b>Why have you decided to become a member? </b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Transparency is a trend which we expect will be a major factor in our continued success as an organisation. My ultimate goal would be that Plan International becomes a transparency leader in our sector by becoming an organisation that is happy to share (and indeed shout about) our successes and failures, cost structures, research and data in real time. Everything for all to see. No filters, no \\u2018for internal eyes only\\u2019.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Joining IATI will lead to a standardised way of measuring the material impact on the lives of girls that Plan\\u2019s interventions and campaigns has. Using the IATI Standard provides the basis for a standardised approach to this and will help us going forward working with our Country Offices on data collection and management. Ultimately this will lead to more effective interventions and provide us with authoritative data to inform our campaigns.</span></p><p><b>Why is transparency important to Civil Society Organisations?</b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I see a shift to greater transparency in our sector not as an add-on that will bring about a number of benefits, but a necessity for our survival. Gone are the days of people taking information at face value. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Citizens, and especially young people, challenge their political representatives on all levels. Patients challenge doctors on opinions and treatment options. Donors challenge charities on where their money goes and what impact it really has. For me, this level of challenge and empowerment is a great thing, but we need to respond to it in the right way. True transparency has to be simple and understandable to all audiences.</span></p><p><b>What information will you publish?</b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">IATI gives us a way to communicate the most critical elements of our work in a format that can be consumed by many different public data users while helping to alleviate the need to produce multiple reports at different times of the year and for a wide range of individual stakeholders. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Once fully implemented, our IATI releases and those of other publishers will allow us to link our results and expenditure to those of our donors and implementing partners. We want to continue to increase the involvement of the girls we are working to empower, therefore a user-friendly data portal with access to all of our data and an additional avenue for civic engagement is key to bringing our strategy to life.</span></p><p><b>Who do you think will benefit from your data?</b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If we\\u2019re producing data just for the sake of it, we\\u2019re wasting everybody\\u2019s time. I\\u2019d like our information to benefit the children we represent, the individual and institutional donors who fund our work, our peers in our sector and ourselves.</span></p><p><b>Plan International are attending IATI\\u2019s Members\\u2019 Assembly in Rome next week. Are you looking forward to it?</b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Absolutely! We\\u2019re expecting to learn a lot from attending our first Members\\u2019 Assembly, and look forward to discussions with other members on transparency best practice and lessons learned.</span></p><p><b>How else would you like to be involved in the initiative? </b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We are excited about doing our part and are happy to be joining a growing list of member organisations that are putting transparency at the very core of our work, working to improve IATI as a standard and revolutionising the way we communicate across offices and with our partners.</span></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

The code for our 15+ tools and services is written in at least six languages to a variety of coding practices.

Together we manage the menagerie of <a href=\\\"https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-systems-design-architecture-proposal/709\\\">IATI tech</a> \\u2013 a mix of codebases using varied languages and software design patterns</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. The increase in our development and maintenance capacity over the past year is thanks to <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/about/join-iati/\\\">IATI\\u2019s Members\\u2019 Assembly</a> approving an uplift in budget, enabling us to bring new people into the team.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As a recent addition to the IATI Tech Team, I\\u2019ve been spending the last couple of months finding my feet. In the process, I thought it would be good to share some insights about how we work with the wider IATI community.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So here is a casual breakdown of our working week. Enjoy!</span></p><h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Monday</span></h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Monday is our dedicated bug and maintenance\\u00a0</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">day. Of course, if a major emergency crops up we\\u2019ll get it sorted on any day of the week but most Monday projects are small irksome things rather than big hefty problems. We\\u2019ve earmarked one particular day for these projects because, as any software developer knows, maintenance is an ongoing process that needs specific time allocated.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This is especially true for IATI which suffers from a pretty complex code base. </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The code for our 10+ tools and services is written in at least six languages to a variety of coding practices</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. Fun times\\u2026</span></p><p style=\\\"color: #333333; font-style: normal;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://xkcd.com/license.html\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-5287 alignright\\\" height=\\\"618\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/future_self_2x-1-1.original.png\\\" width=\\\"355\\\"/></a></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Delving into the IATI code base is a lot like a C.S. Lewis book. You lose a sock, check your wardrobe for it, and end up in Narnia. You spend many days wandering about, surprised at all the strange creatures you stumble across and, when you leave, hardly anything of any particular relevance will have changed.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This sort of p</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">roblem is pretty ubiquitous when it comes to most code bases of a certain age. The typical circumstances are generally hard to avoid:</span></p><ul>\\n<li><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A series of pragmatic decisions </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">where the need to prove the initial concept comes before there is a real need to think about scalability and long-term maintenance</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.</span></li>\\n<li><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The need to respond quickly to early user needs leaves limited time for improving code.</span></li>\\n</ul><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">These sorts of things </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">leave us with software that is functional and demonstrates early user value but ultimately requires significant effort to keep working over the long term.</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> A perpetual victim of what we in the business call \\u2018software rot\\u2019.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Allocating specific time for regular maintenance keeps us on top of high priority issues while allowing us to move forward without spending 15 years fighting for Aslan against the White Witch.</span></p><h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Tuesday-Thursday</span></h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">These days are our main product development days. At the moment this is mostly taken up by creating IATI\\u2019s new python library </span><a href=\\\"https://github.com/IATI/iati.core\\\"><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">pyIATI</span></i></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> (pronounced pie-at-ee!).</span></p><p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/IATI/iati.core\\\"><strong>pyIATI \\u2013 a developers\\u2019 tool kit for IATI</strong></a><b> </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">aims to consolidate duplicated efforts across the IATI code base, create a central point of reference for all our IATI tools, and reduce the maintenance cost of the code base. It\\u2019s basically magic.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Learning from lessons of the past and doing what we can to adhere to best practices means the processes we are using for pyIATI put </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">quality, stability and longevity</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> first.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This means:</span></p><ul>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Building features based on User Stories</span></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Robust testing</span></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Regular code reviews</span></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Communication and knowledge sharing</span></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Frequent refactoring (restructuring code to improve non-functional aspects)</span></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Clear documentation added as we go</span></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Research and evaluation of processes</span></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Iterating over assumptions and design</span></li>\\n</ul><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">All of this takes more time up front but will be a huge time-saver in the long run.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To switch to construction metaphors, think of it like carpentry. It may take longer initially to measure up your plank at least twice, but you\\u2019re saving a lot of time and money later when you only need to cut it once. The alternative being messing it up, running out of materials, and having to go back to the store to spend yet more time and money buying replacements.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Except, in our case, you\\u2019ll only need to fetch your data once, or convert to CSV once for example. Right now, those tasks are happening at least three times a piece which significantly increases maintenance effort when bugs crop up.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It\\u2019s also a question of foundations. The initial foundations of IATI were </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">based on prototypes and so require significant effort to keep running</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. Things built on these foundations are fighting a losing battle and will eventually be swallowed up by encroaching entropy like a slowly sinking house. For example, we would like to add new features and improved functionality to the Dashboard and Datastore, but just keeping up with existing reported issues for these tools already takes up too many of our resources.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">pyIATI is a big effort to underpin the foundations and shore everything up now, before we end up with serious subsidence problems later. In the case of IATI, pyIATI means it will be easier to extend existing tool functionality, create new shiny end-user tools, and fix problems with existing ones. We don\\u2019t want an unmanageable swamp of bugs swallowing up our ability to incorporate new user requirements.</span></p><h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Friday</span></h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The end of the week offers a chance to tidy up loose ends from our main product development days, as well as manage relationships with external suppliers, engage with the community, and reflect on our workflow to improve our own processes.</span></p><h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Upcoming</span></h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So that\\u2019s what our working week looks like right now. We\\u2019re on track to start using pyIATI for the project to build a new IATI website in the coming weeks. This will be a great way to test its real-world functionality and identify areas for improvement in order to streamline future projects. #TheJoysOfSoftware</span></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Whether it\\u2019s a charity in the UK, a company in Malaysia, or a government department in Canada, the ability to describe these different entities in a consistent way is key to opening and linking up data about their activities.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This collaboration of data standard bodies has agreed to provide and maintain a shared register of the lists where organisation identifiers are found at org-id.guide (replacing and updating the </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">IATI <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/\\\">Organisation Registration Agency </a></span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">codelis</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">t). The project builds on the methodology developed by IATI of presenting identifiers in two parts \\u2013 a list code, and the identifier drawn from that list. \\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\\\"color: #808080;\\\"><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">International Women\\u2019s Development Agency organisation identifier</span></i></span><br/>\\n<img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-5054 aligncenter\\\" height=\\\"126\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/org-id.original.png\\\" style=\\\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: 300;\\\" width=\\\"215\\\"/></p><h3><b><i>Background: why do we need organisation identifiers?</i></b></h3><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There may be many organisations in the same country with the same name; an organisation might change its name; or the name may be written in different ways in different places. However, no two organisations should have the same number or identifier in an official list, and their number generally doesn\\u2019t change. Using this identifier alongside an organisation name makes sure data clearly references the right organisation, and so links can be made across datasets that refer to the same organisation. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">However, it is still possible that two different lists might include the same number \\u2013 but for different organisations. That\\u2019s why org-id.guide provides codes for each identifier list. Combining these with the identifiers gives globally unique and unambiguous ways to reference an organisation. \\u00a0</span></p><h3><b><i>How does org-id.guide help?</i></b></h3><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-5062 alignright\\\" height=\\\"347\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/org-id.guide-2-2.original.png\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/org-id.guide-2-2.original.png 887w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.guide-2-2-450x398.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.guide-2-2-768x680.png 768w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.guide-2-2-600x531.png 600w\\\" style=\\\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: 300;\\\" width=\\\"391\\\"/></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Us</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">ers can easily search by </span><b>country, type of organisation and sector</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> through org-</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">id.guide\\u2019s directory of </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">official registration agencies and third party lists to help find organisation identifiers.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Based on the search criteria, org-id.guide provides the lists that are most likely to have the organisation identifier you are looking for.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Even better, org-id.guide ranks the results according to the reliability of the identifiers, the availability of public search, and the provision of open data for the lists:</span></p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5068\\\" height=\\\"336\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Suggested-Lists.original.png\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Suggested-Lists.original.png 602w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Suggested-Lists-450x251.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Suggested-Lists-600x335.png 600w\\\" width=\\\"602\\\"/></p><h3><b><i>Who is org-id.guide for?</i></b></h3><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Org-id.guide is particularly helpful to:</span></p><ul>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">organisations publishing open data for the first time who need to find their own organisation identifier</span></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">publishers naming other organisations in their data to ensure it is more accurate and more machine-searchable</span></li>\\n</ul><h3><b><i>What if there\\u2019s no list that can help me?</i></b></h3><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Just let us know by posting a request </span><a href=\\\"http://docs.org-id.guide\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">as described in our contributors\\u2019 handbook</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> and we\\u2019ll research potential lists that might contain the identifiers you need.</span></p><h3><b><i>What difference will org-id.guide make?</i></b></h3><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We hope that org-id-guide will improve interoperability between datasets.

The event sought to showcase the thriving open data community on the continent, bringing together open data advocates, journalists, sector specialists and software developers from across Africa and beyond.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Representatives from the </span><a href=\\\"https://www.interaction.org/project/open-ag-funding/overview\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Initiative for Open Ag Funding</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> and the </span><a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> (IATI) Secretariat were both in attendance. While we had different reasons for taking part in the conference, we had a common cause \\u2013 to demonstrate IATI data, promote its use and listen to suggestions on how to make it more useful. Below are our top five takeaways:</span></p><h2>1. There\\u2019s no shortage of impassioned pleas for data</h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While the IATI community often laments the lack of apparent data users, we found the very opposite at AODC. There was no shortage of impassioned pleas for information on development spending, and once people became aware of IATI, they were hungry for more. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">More often than not, individuals had very specific information needs, wanting to look in detail at one or two specific donors or projects to understand their objectives, commitments, disbursements and impact. They also wanted to know the process of validation to understand how reliable the data was. Attendees did recognise, however, that introducing more layers of validation would delay early access to key information with which they could hold officials to account. Nevertheless, the users are there, and they want more data.</span></p><h2>2. We need to refocus our efforts towards in-country users</h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Greater attention needs to be paid to engaging with the recipient country civil society users, as well as their governments. Our demonstrations of </span><a href=\\\"http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=search\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">IATI\\u2019s search tool, d-portal</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> were met with enthusiasm and interest. However, we found that requests for support would quickly outpace our ability to deliver it. Our takeaway from this was the \\u00a0significant need for more focused in-country work promoting ways to use and share IATI data.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">At the same time, we should be clear about who the target users for IATI data are. Some of the people we met, such as journalists and government transparency advocates, were clearly interested in being direct consumers of this data, but many end users will benefit from IATI only indirectly. In other words, the IATI intermediaries \\u2013 developers, data quality advocates, transparency nerds \\u2013 need to ensure that we\\u2019re providing data that is useful for national and local governments, local CSOs, and the general public, via formats and tools that they can readily use and access.</span></p><h2>3. Good, comprehensive data is not enough</h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We need tools to more effectively access and query the data. One significant challenge for IATI is the difficulty in using the data. We found that simply sharing the links to available tools was not enough, as people were unable to understand what they were looking at, its context or how to use it. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Further investment in data visualisations and simple query tools are vital if people are to start using the data. Without this, progress will only be made through one-to-one training which, while important, is not a sustainable way towards ensuring that data is used to improve development effectiveness. With such an engaged IATI community already familiar with the data, creating these kinds of tools is possible and would result in significant benefits for different user groups.</span></p><h2>4. We have to acknowledge that IATI is just one piece of the puzzle</h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Development data is only one piece of a broader \\u2018data-ecosystem\\u2019 and is often needed alongside other data to enable proper analysis. There is much that the producers and intermediaries of this data can do to ensure that it is fit for purpose and accessible to intended users, but we should not forget that local data brokers -innovation hubs, tech companies, data scientists, incubators \\u2013 can play a significant role in adding value and context to IATI data flows and repurposing it for local use and consumption. One example heard by the Initiative for Open Ag Funding was that aid investment flows by crop type juxtaposed with crop type yield by location would enable significantly more in-depth analysis.</span></p><h2>5. IATI is more than data, it\\u2019s also a library</h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">One of the most attractive aspects of the IATI Standard is that publishers can link to project documents. The list of documents available often includes country strategies, budgets, \\u00a0project evaluations and even business and procurement documents. We found that users wanted the ability to peruse project documents as part of their investigations and research and, thus, we shouldn\\u2019t assume that \\u2018data is the only way\\u2019. With this, we should continue to push publishers to share not just the data but all the accompanying documentation so that IATI can serve as a useful library, as well as a data repository. </span></p><p>\\u00a0</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

See IATI website for more.\\u00a0</em></p><p style=\\\"padding-left: 30px;\\\"><em>While acknowledging progress in completeness and timeliness of data from development partners on development cooperation, the latest DCF Accountability Study calls for greater attention and efforts to address the persisting challenges facing developing countries, including uneven accessibility of development cooperation information systems for different stakeholders; difficulties in collecting quality data through existing development cooperation information systems; and lack of financial resources to develop and strengthen development cooperation information systems.\\u00a0</em></p><p><em><a href=\\\"https://developmentfinance.un.org/transparency-and-needs-assessment\\\"><strong>Data, monitoring and Follow-up: Transparency and needs assessment</strong></a></em></p><div class=\\\"views-field views-field-field-section-intro\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"field-content\\\" style=\\\"padding-left: 30px;\\\"><em>There has been a strong surge in the total number of organisations publishing data to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standard. The total now stands at over 500, an increase by more than one third from 350 in late 2015. During the same period, publishers have significantly expanded the volume of activities they publish, with spending of US$146 billion reported to IATI in 2016, rising from US$78 billion in 2015. Timeliness of reporting has improved, with 96 per cent of the data (US$140 billion) reported by publishers updating their data at least every quarter \\u2013 increasing from 80 per cent in 2015; 48 per cent of data is provided by publishers updating their data at least every month \\u00a0\\u2013 rising from 41 per cent in 2015.\\u00a0</em></p>\\n<p class=\\\"field-content\\\" style=\\\"padding-left: 30px;\\\"><em>Donors have significantly increased the amount of forward-looking budget data they publish. In late 2015 published forward-looking data on planned international development cooperation expenditure rose to US$126 billion for 2017 and 2018. These improvements by publishers are helping to meet partner country requests for more timely and forward-looking data and making the data more valuable for a broad range of stakeholders. Different means of accessing and using IATI data are becoming available at country level, with systems providers beginning to include modules for importing IATI data directly into national Aid Information Management Systems. As the volume of good quality reliable data increases, partner country members of IATI such as Bangladesh, Liberia, Madagascar, Myanmar and others are now able to use the data to inform reporting and budgeting. National representatives also use it to learn more about projects reported in their constituencies not just by bilateral and multilateral donors, but also by international and national NGOs, foundations and increasingly \\u2013 private sector organisations.</em></p>\\n</div>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

But how much of the money I contribute as a taxpayer arrives on the ground to deliver vital goods and services to people in need? Answering this question proves difficult.</p><p>To get a clear picture of the aims and objectives of aid programs, where activities are being delivered, and how they are financed, we require information that\\u2019s often trapped in multiple organisational silos.</p><p>At IATI\\u2019s recent <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/events/tag-2017-announced/\\\">Technical Advisory Group</a> meeting in Dar es Salaam, we set out to discuss how we can connect information on aid flows and contracts by joining up data published using two different data standards.</p><p>We have explored this relationship in <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDDSBYCt-FPI2jV1d226j9GBkQVCTIHkQtZk42PoBBU/edit?usp=sharing\\\">more detail</a>, but here\\u2019s a summary.</p><p>First, we identified the core focus of each standard:</p><ul>\\n<li>The IATI standard starts from an \\u2018aid activity\\u2019, which may relate to a large-scale program involving many partners or a simple project delivered on the ground in a particular locality. Aid activities can be linked together in a delivery chain where, for example, a program funds a countrywide project, which then funds a local project.IATI captures classifications of the aid, location data, information about partners, and details of incoming and outgoing transactions for each activity.</li>\\n</ul><ul>\\n<li>The <a href=\\\"http://www.open-contracting.org/about/\\\">Open Contracting Data Standard</a> (OCDS) starts from the \\u201ccontracting process\\u201d and captures information on each stage, from planning, through tender, to award, contract and implementation.In general, each OCDS record relates to a single tender but may incorporate multiple awards and contracts signed, and implemented, as a result of one initial solicitation.</li>\\n</ul><p>These standards also differ on a technical level. The IATI standard uses an XML data model, whereas the OCDS uses JSON as its primary schema language.</p><p>Once the focus of each standard was evident, we explored how they related to each other. We discussed three models at the Dar es Salaam meeting.</p><ul>\\n<li><b>When an aid activity and contracting process are essentially the same thing </b>\\u2013 for example, when a government plans an aid project and contracts a single supplier to deliver it.<b><br/>\\n</b></li>\\n</ul><ul>\\n<li><strong>When an aid activity leads to one or more contracting process(es)</strong> \\u2013 for example, when a program is planned and tenders run to find a number of suppliers who will be involved in delivering the program.</li>\\n</ul><ul>\\n<li><strong>When a contracting process leads to one or more aid activities</strong> \\u2013 for example, a tender is issued to solicit ideas for new aid programs and once the ideas are collected, a budget is allocated and aid activities started.</li>\\n</ul><p>The relationship can vary from case-to-case and country-to-country depending on the administrative processes, so any integration between the standards needs to take these different models into account.</p><p>During the third step we dived into the technical approaches to the integration. In our <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDDSBYCt-FPI2jV1d226j9GBkQVCTIHkQtZk42PoBBU/edit#\\\">working paper</a>, we outline the use of <b>identifier cross-references</b> and <b>document links</b> to establish clear connections between contracting and aid.</p><p>This would require only minor updates to the two standards, such as adding relevant codelist entries. Current implementers of the OCDS and IATI standard should be able to add these to their publication processes relatively easily.</p><p>Fortunately this is already happening. In our workshop, we heard that donors such as the UK Department for International Development and Global Affairs Canada have started to make these links. We will now explore the different approaches in more detail and seek partners and case studies. Have you worked on either? Let us know! We\\u2019d love to learn more.</p><p>Post your comments and suggestions on\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://www.open-contracting.org/2017/03/29/linking-aid-contracts/\\\">open-contracting.org</a>.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Here are seven ways I think we can keep moving forwards together:</span></p><h2>1. Champion IATI at country-level</h2><p>With almost 70% of our participants attending their first IATI meeting, the event was as much about introducing our initiative, as it was improving it with long-standing members.</p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It was encouraging to hear that, after learning about accessing IATI data through </span><a href=\\\"http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=search\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">d-portal.org</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, representatives from Sierra Leone were keen to use it to support their government\\u2019s budget process and promote the initiative on an upcoming broadcast programme. This shows the power of IATI to engage a wide range of people in partner countries.</span></p><p><strong>Your challenge: champion IATI to your colleagues in developing countries, including within country donor offices.</strong></p><h2>2. Support IATI\\u2019s inclusion in internal systems</h2><p>Developing countries also said they would benefit from technical support to integrate IATI data into their existing government processes and systems.</p><p>During our excellent lighting-talks, the Government of Liberia shared their progress on working with Mark Brough on using IATI data in their internal information management systems for better aid coordination.</p><p><strong>Your challenge: Work with government partners to help get IATI data into government systems.</strong></p><h2>3. Sell the benefits to IATI publishers</h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">IATI is still a young standard and many organisations are interested in being a part of it.

Our review of available literature identified three key use cases:</span></p><ul>\\n<li><b>Increasing transparency<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, through the application of a common and open reporting standard to enable access and use of comprehensive, comparable, timely and forward-looking data on financial resource flows.</span></b></li>\\n<li><b>Increasing efficiency and effectiveness<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, through the use of IATI data in planning, coordinating and mobilising resources for better development interventions.</span></b></li>\\n<li><b>Increasing accountability<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, through the use of IATI data by a range of official and non-official actors to monitor delivery, detect corruption and advocate for improvements. \\u00a0</span></b></li>\\n</ul><h2>Who\\u2019s making the most use of IATI data now?</h2><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Surprisingly it\\u2019s donors\\u2026 IATI was originally established with the aim of meeting the demand from developing country governments for timely, comprehensive and forward-looking information on external resources.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">However by far the most evident current use case for this data in practice is in information portals set up by donors and development partners. Due to their focus on (mostly) individual providers, these efforts primarily serve to demonstrate transparency and accountability to a domestic or international audience.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Our report lists 12 such portals currently operating, spanning major bilateral aid providers as well as multilateral actors.</span></p><h2>Are developing countries using IATI?</h2><h5><strong><em>Local aid management systems</em></strong></h5><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Using the data for decision-making processes crucially depends on the level of integration of IATI with local AIMS (Aid Information Management Systems). In </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://tinyurl.com/BD-IATI-AIMS\\\">Bangladesh</a>,</span> <span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/using-data/how-IATI-improves-data-use/\\\">Rwanda</a>,\\u00a0</span><a href=\\\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/IATI-JuneSCMeetings-FINAL.pdf\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Chad, Cote d\\u2019Ivoire, Madagascar, and Senegal</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> work has been undertaken to import IATI data into AIMS. </span></p><h5><em><strong>Full picture of resources </strong></em></h5><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Some governments are regularly using IATI data to check and/or complement their own data. For example, in Liberia the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning </span><a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/news/using-iati-data-60-second-interview-with-liberian-government\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">reported using IATI data</span></a> <span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">to monitor flow of external resources in the context of the Ebola crisis.</span></p><h5><em><strong>Accountability</strong></em></h5><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Evidence for use of IATI-based information to hold development resource providers and implementers to account is perhaps most limited to date. An example of this use case involved efforts to monitor implementation of DFID-funded NGO projects by the </span><a href=\\\"http://integrityaction.org/sites/default/files/publication/files/Publication_NTA%20Integrity%20Action%20Aid%20Transaprency%20Pilot%20Project.pdf\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">National Taxpayers Association together with Integrity Action</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> in Kenya.</span></p><h2>What does our community need to work on?</h2><ul>\\n<li><b><i>Raising awareness at national level</i> </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\\u2013 Busy government officials may not be aware that IATI even exists and we need greater efforts to promote the initiative. From the review, donor country offices of leading IATI publishers indicated an urgent need to raise awareness.</span></li>\\n<li><b><i>Supporting integration with in-country aid management systems</i></b> \\u2013\\u00a0We need to work together to ensure more countries implement the automatic import of IATI data into their AIMS. For this to be sustainable, there needs to be ownership by developing country governments, as observed in Myanmar\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://mohinga.info/en/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Mohinga</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> and Bangladesh\\u2019s own home-grown AIMS.</span></li>\\n<li><b><i>Evidence of value added</i> </b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\\u2013</span> <b><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To encourage more use, we need a clear evidence base on how IATI data adds value to government systems and their decision making processes.</span></i></b></li>\\n<li><b><i>New solutions and tools for different users needs</i></b> \\u2013 <b><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">we need</span> <span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">more in-depth research on what </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">specific problems</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> IATI can solve. This will contribute to developing appropriate support as well as technical and analytical tools.</span></i></b></li>\\n<li><b>Overcoming key technical obstacles</b> \\u2013\\u00a0Existing IATI tools need to be improved, in particular making the Datastore more user-friendly. Improvements to data quality and the Standard through better publication of data by organisations such as accurate sub-locations, local language descriptions, use or related field to enable traceability of funds, etc.</li>\\n</ul><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To achieve the above, we need more investment, as well as political will, from many key stakeholders including developing country governments, donors and other non-state actors. Being at TAG 2017 has filled me with confidence that the IATI community is ready to meet these challenges. </span></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Organisations publish information on their spending to the standard set by IATI and this data is available, open and free to anyone in the world with internet access.</p><p><strong><em>Supporting developing country governments</em></strong><em>:</em> The IATI Standard meets the demand from developing country governments for timely, comprehensive and forward-looking information on external resources to better inform their decision making.</p><ul>\\n<li><strong>Better planning</strong>: IATI allow donors to share aid budgets several years in advance, so developing country governments are able to better plan for the future.</li>\\n<li><strong>Up-to-date information</strong>: funds can be reported quarterly, monthly and even daily, which can be crucial in a humanitarian emergency</li>\\n<li><strong>Providing the bigger picture:</strong> IATI allows different types of development resources to be recorded.

For example it allows for reporting on the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals.</li>\\n<li><strong>Information is comparable</strong>: Different organisations publish data into our common format<strong>,</strong> allowing users to easily compare information that was previously published in different ways.</li>\\n</ul><p>IATI also helps provide citizens, journalists, CSOs, politicians and others with the information required for holding development actors to account throughout the delivery chain. In addition, donors are able to better prioritise their spending with more information on when and where other development resources are being delivered.</p><h4><strong><span style=\\\"color: #b8c400;\\\">How has IATI been involved in the GPEDC?</span></strong></h4><p>In 2011, IATI was referenced in the transparency commitment made in paragraph 23c of the <a href=\\\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/49650173.pdf\\\">Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation</a>. \\u00a0Development organisations signed up to a \\u2018common, open standard for electronic publication of timely, comprehensive and forward-looking information on resources provided through development co-operation\\u2019. At the previous HLM in 2014, IATI agreed a new Global Partnership Initiative (<a href=\\\"http://effectivecooperation.org/monitoring-country-progress/global-partnership-initiatives/\\\">GPI</a>) that was annexed to the Mexico Communiqu\\u00e9.

It is only right that we set an example by sharing good quality, timely and open data on our activities. So we have decided to increase our transparency by providing a comprehensive dataset on our grant portfolio, in line with international best practice, namely the International Aid Transparency Initiative\\u00a0(IATI).</p><p style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\"><strong><span style=\\\"font-style: inherit;\\\">Why this matters</span></strong></p><ul style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\">\\n<li style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\">Development finance is hard to track, especially, but not only in developing countries. And keeping abreast of the myriad initiatives and projects in the spaces that we operate can be a challenge! It\\u2019s worth considering a few different users of information and the challenges they face.</li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #b8c400;\\\">Civil servants often don\\u2019t have accurate information on international investments in their countries.</span> For example, Ghanaian education ministry officials are often in the dark about foreign investments in the education sector, undermining their ability to plan Ghana\\u2019s education budget effectively, learn about different models, and identify relative capital gaps.</li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #b8c400;\\\">International development funders similarly lack good data on current activities.</span> While we may know well the work of our closest peers, the multiplicity of funders in many sectors can lead to duplication, under-funded sectors and geographies, and high transaction costs on partners.</li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #b8c400;\\\">Journalists and researchers want good quality, comparable data</span> on development activities to gain insights, identify trends, and influence future interventions.</li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #b8c400;\\\">Grantees and their partners often struggle</span> to get reliable information about work happening in parallel sectors and other countries. By providing data that complies with common classifications, we can make it easier for them to discover and learn from other initiatives.</li>\\n</ul><p style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\">Transparency of funding is a work in progress: all actors will have to contribute to achieve a full picture. But by providing information in line with our bilateral, multilateral, and philanthropic peers, Omidyar Network will be helping to strengthen country systems, support better decision-making by the global funding network, and will make us and our peers more effective grant makers through increased peer\\u00a0learning.</p><p style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\"><strong><span style=\\\"font-style: inherit;\\\">How we\\u2019re addressing this</span></strong></p><p style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\">As of November 2016, we will be disclosing, on a quarterly basis, data on our nonprofit portfolio, in a structured data format that complies with the IATI standard, now used by the majority of international development funders. You can read our <a href=\\\"https://www.omidyar.com/values-policies\\\" style=\\\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\\\">IATI policy</a> to understand our approach in detail.

This can result in data that is difficult to use and reduce the transparency of the overall flow of aid. The challenge now is to ensure that transparency data is actually used to improve development effectiveness. DFID will make it a key requirement to enhance the quality and use of data. At a minimum, by the end of 2017, centrally funded CSOs will be required to meet the full International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard on all their funding, and ensure that all the organisations in their delivery chain also meet the standard. DFID will continually review its transparency requirements, with a view to expanding and enhancing them in the coming months and years. DFID will work collaboratively with both Bond and other donor governments to explore the possibility of reducing DFID reporting requirements where CSOs proactively publish their data through IATI. </span></i></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

At the <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/about/join-iati/\\\">2016 IATI Members Assembly</a>, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, the United States, Belgium, Finland, Publish What You Fund, UNFPA, UNICEF, and the African Development Bank met to establish how to use IATI data to increase the traceability of activities through multilateral organisations.</p><p>UNFPA joined IATI and has been publishing data on activities to its <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/\\\">Standard</a> since 2012. Launched in 2008, IATI enables the publication of machine-readable, timely, comprehensive and forward-looking development information in a common, open format. The rapid increase in IATI publishers (today at nearly 500) has allowed data users to access a growing share of the world\\u2019s development cooperation activities via IATI\\u2019s online <a href=\\\"http://www.iatiregistry.org/\\\">Registry</a> and <a href=\\\"http://datastore.iatistandard.org/docs/\\\">Datastore</a>. IATI\\u2019s Standard has also evolved to accommodate a wider range of data user\\u2019s needs. These include the <strong>automated use of IATI data </strong>to populate key information and decision-making systems; the<strong> reporting of humanitarian assistance</strong> during emergencies; and <strong>harmonisation of data from all publishers</strong> to common frameworks such as the <a href=\\\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm\\\">OECD-DAC</a>, the <a href=\\\"http://www.unfpa.org/icpd\\\">International Conference on Population and Development</a> and the <a href=\\\"http://www.unfpa.org/sdg\\\">Sustainable Development Goals</a> among <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/SectorVocabulary/\\\">others</a>.</p><p>IATI has empowered many development actors and data aggregators to establish open data portals\\u00a0(for example Sweden\\u2019s <a href=\\\"http://openaid.se/aid/2015/\\\">Openaid.se</a> and the Netherland\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://www.openaid.nl/\\\">OpenNL</a>). These are built on the IATI Standard and linked to the IATI Registry to streamline information collection, reduce traditional manual data entry, and allow for more efficient coordination of development activities over time. In a growing number of cases, these portals have become the norm for reporting and communicating development activities and their outcomes within ministries, parliaments and congressional bodies. The need for machine-readable data from implementing partners \\u2013 including multilateral organisations and pooled funding vehicles \\u2013 has become one of the most significant hurdles donors face as they look to streamline information sharing and reduce manual data entry.</p><p>The Netherlands has been leading automated traceability efforts of their financing through IATI with a <a href=\\\"https://www.drostan.org/2016/06/iati-traceability-in-the-health-systems-advocacy-partnership/?utm_campaign=coschedule&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=rolfkleef&amp;utm_content=IATI%20Traceability%20in%20the%20Health%20Systems%20Advocacy%20Partnership\\\">handful of NGOs</a> and introduced mandatory IATI publishing for most activities funded by the government this year. In May, they set sights on a seemingly more ambitious target and approached several UN agencies to come up with a strategy that would allow contributions to multi-donor funds, specifically core support to UN agencies, to be linked to development outcomes. Since launching their data portal in 2014, Sweden has also communicated several obstacles they face in having to manually enter data related to core contributions to multilateral organisations, <a href=\\\"http://openaid.se/aid/sweden/multilateral-core-support/united-nations-population-fund/all/2015/\\\">including UNFPA</a>.</p><p>In establishing this traceability pilot, we will seek to overcome these issues and aim to reduce the need for manual reporting. Working with the consortium, our goal is to eliminate ad-hoc reports over time and increase the flow of information from one agency to another automatically through IATI. Here are our three keys to success:</p><p><strong>The first</strong> is to establish how and in what specific marker one organisation will be referencing another.</p><p><img alt=\\\"traceability-2\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4190\\\" height=\\\"116\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/traceability-2.original.png\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/traceability-2.original.png 577w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/traceability-2-450x90.png 450w\\\" width=\\\"577\\\"/></p><p>\\u00a0</p><p>\\u00a0</p><p><strong>The second</strong> is to create a pool funding arm (activity) for each multilateral organisation that is able to reference the core contributions of bilateral donors.</p><p><img alt=\\\"unfpa-traceability\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4191\\\" height=\\\"241\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/UNFPA-traceability-1.original.png\\\" width=\\\"417\\\"/></p><p>\\u00a0</p><p>\\u00a0</p><p>\\u00a0</p><p>\\u00a0</p><p>\\u00a0</p><p>\\u00a0</p><p><strong>The third and final</strong> is to make sure that all core and pool-funded activities and related results show a relationship to the established pool funding activity.</p><p><img alt=\\\"traceability-3\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4192\\\" height=\\\"337\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/traceability-3.original.png\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/traceability-3.original.png 576w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/traceability-3-450x263.png 450w\\\" width=\\\"576\\\"/></p><p>\\u00a0</p><p>This multi-stakeholder pilot promises to streamline information collection, help avoid double-reporting, reduce traditional manual data entry and allow for more efficient coordination of development activities.

Coherent, timely data is a key element of this complex response matrix and at the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016, 33 of the world\\u2019s largest donors and humanitarian agencies <a href=\\\"https://consultations.worldhumanitariansummit.org/bitcache/075d4c18b82e0853e3d393e90af18acf734baf29?vid=581058&amp;disposition=inline&amp;op=view\\\">committed themselves</a> to \\u201cidentifying and implementing a shared open-data standard and common digital platform which will enhance transparency and decision-making\\u201d. The publishing <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/\\\">standard</a> maintained by the International Aid Transparency Initiative (<a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/\\\">IATI</a>) was recommended as the vehicle for this effort.</p><p>In preparation for this \\u2018Grand Bargain\\u2019 IATI has modified its standard to better meet the requirements of humanitarian reporting. These modifications were done in consultation with, amongst others, <a href=\\\"https://fts.unocha.org/\\\">OCHA\\u2019s Financial Tracking Service</a> (FTS), the <a href=\\\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/resources-campaigns/online-databases/edris-european-emergency-disaster-response-information-system_en\\\">European Emergency Disaster Response Information System</a> as well as organisations such as the <a href=\\\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\\\">UK Disasters Emergency Committee</a> and the <a href=\\\"http://www.startnetwork.org/\\\">Start Network</a>.</p><p>For humanitarian decision-making to be effectively harmonised, data from a variety of sources needs to be joined up. The way in which emergencies are defined and reported is an essential part of this. One improvement to the IATI Standard was thus the inclusion of a new element \\u2013 <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/humanitarian-scope/\\\">humanitarian-scope</a> \\u2013 which provides a means of accurately defining emergencies and appeals. This is done by specifying a \\u2018vocabulary\\u2019 \\u2013 a globally recognised list of classifications \\u2013 which maintains a curated list of codes.</p><p>For a standards body like IATI this raises a number of issues. Here are four considerations\\u2026</p><ul>\\n<li><strong>What recognised authority lists (vocabularies) exist?\\u00a0</strong>No global classification system exists that encompasses all humanitarian emergencies. IATI and OCHA have agreed that the best approach for classifying emergencies is to adopt <a href=\\\"http://www.glidenumber.net/glide/public/search/search.jsp\\\">GLIDE numbers</a>, a <strong>Gl</strong>obal <strong>IDE</strong>ntifier coding system for natural disasters originally developed by the <a href=\\\"http://www.adrc.asia/\\\">Asian Disaster Reduction Center</a>. OCHA is a <a href=\\\"http://www.glidenumber.net/glide/public/institutions.jsp\\\">participating institution</a> and as such can generate new GLIDE numbers. Furthermore, there is agreement that the system can be extended to include man-made as well as natural disasters.For GLIDE to be recognised as the key global standard there is a need for all participating institutions to advocate for its adoption by all humanitarian-related information systems.</li>\\n<li><strong>How are codes accessed?\\u00a0</strong>Currently, users of the system are provided with email notifications of changes and can only access the database through manual downloads. This is far from ideal, particularly for data production in the early stages of a sudden-onset disaster.For GLIDE to progress it will have to be dynamically accessible by machines. Investment in a robust API that allows for automated discovery and retrieval of codes will be essential.</li>\\n<li><strong>How are codes created and maintained?\\u00a0</strong>Whenever a new emergency arises a participating institution can create a GLIDE number. If timely data is required urgently in sudden-onset emergencies there is little time for traditional methods of consultation and agreement between participating institutions. Furthermore, as IATI\\u2019s reporting base grows there will be a need for the registration of local emergencies that may fall beneath the radar of the large participating institutions.There will thus be a need for a collaborative, technical framework that allows for rapid consultation and approval of new codes.</li>\\n<li><strong>How will users of the data make sense of the codes?\\u00a0</strong>Humanitarian financial and operational management has been developed in such a way that emergencies are defined and coded by country and year as well as by the disaster itself \\u2212 multi-country and multi-year emergencies have new codes generated for each country and year. For a user of IATI data to analyse activities related to the West African Ebola epidemic a search would need to be done across 12 unique emergency codes (three countries over four years). The GLIDE number does also include an event-type code and \\u201cEP (Epidemic)\\u201d is one of them, but parsing identifiers is not easy.IATI will need to consider how to provide a searchable item to improve access to the data.</li>\\n</ul><p>IATI is a voluntary standard. It has no power to enforce compliance. It is dependent on the good will of publishers and peer pressure from the humanitarian community as a whole. Improving humanitarian data will require collective efforts from all quarters.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Our thoughts go out to his wife, Chloe, his family and all those touched by such a rich life cut tragically short.</span></p><p>Before Simon joined Development Initiatives he worked for the UK Department for International Development (DFID). This tribute, by Charles Agnew (DFID Head of Business Solutions), was posted on DFID\\u2019s intranet:</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\\u201c<em>Simon worked for DFID for many years before joining Development Initiatives. He was an enthusiastic and inspirational person who made significant contributions to the use of technology in development programmes through PRISM, ARIES, the International Aid Transparency Initiative, and was instrumental in forming the Business Analysis function within DFID. He was a passionate advocate of improving the lives of people in developing countries and was well respected by the people he worked with and will be deeply missed. Our thoughts are with Simon\\u2019s wife Chloe and his family at this difficult time</em>.\\u201d</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">At DI Simon spent his first year leading up to the Accra High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness collecting the evidence and building the case for transparent, timely and forward-looking data \\u2013 encapsulated in a</span><a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/documents/IATI-scoping-paper-2009.pdf\\\"> <span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Scoping Paper</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> which was finally published in early 2009. This intellectual work underpinned the creation of IATI in Accra in September 2008.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Simon immediately became a key member of the IATI Secretariat. Together with </span><b><i>Brian Hammond</i></b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, then Chair of the Technical Advisory Group, he was responsible for building the IATI Standard, distilling the disparate views of a broad range of interested organisations. According to Brian,</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">\\u201c<em>Simon had that rare ability to combine understanding of the aid business and its information needs with a knowledge of applying new and emerging technologies to meet those needs. His skills were fundamental in providing leadership and technical guidance to the IATI Technical Advisory Group from its inception to agreement on the IATI Standard in 2011. The proof of this is shown by the adoption and use of the standard by nearly 500 organisations so far. His friendliness and infectious enthusiasm will be sorely missed by all those who were lucky enough to work with him</em>.\\u201d</p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A critical part of the work building the standard involved understanding the needs of developing countries and translating these into technical demands that were acceptable to their development partners. Country work was led by </span><b><i>Danila Boneva</i></b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> who represented UNDP on the Secretariat from 2009 to 2011. Danila reflects:</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">\\u201c<em>I will always remember Simon smiling and laughing off all adversaries and controversies surrounding the initiative in its early days. All doubts were cast away; all excruciating technical questions had a response in Simon and we could just focus on the tasks in front of us and look for solutions. Simon was incredibly talented and modest, which is a rare combination. He always looked for the best in people, in situations, in problem-solving. His whole personality was one of a humane human being, someone that understood others and would help them when they needed it. Being a member of the early IATI team remains an unforgettable experience because of people like Simon and the rest of the wonderful colleagues I worked with in 2009-2011</em>.\\u201d</p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The IATI Standard became operational at the beginning of 2011. </span><b><i>Alasdair Wardhaugh</i></b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> from DFID was the coordinator of the Secretariat at that time. He attests:</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\\u201c<em>I worked closely with Simon on creating the IATI Standard, when he used his intellect and passion to sell the concept to the world\\u2019s biggest (and until then least transparent) donors. IATI\\u2019s expansion was hugely down to his efforts. \\u00a0But it was always about the end not the means for him and his work to empower civil society in Nepal through information has been transformational</em>.\\u201d</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It was fitting that it was Simon that led the presentation of IATI in Busan in November 2011. At that stage we could boast 17 publishers. Over the next couple of years his stewardship of the IATI Technical Team saw this number rise steadily. According to </span><b><i>John Adams</i></b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, current TAG Chair:</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\\u201c<em>Simon always had a clear vision for IATI and worked tirelessly to bring that to fruition. His deep knowledge, strong passion and infectious enthusiasm made him fabulously effective. He built strong relationships with such a wide range of people, and this was fundamental in gaining broad support for IATI. IATI would have got nowhere without Simon. I will miss his support, advice and ideas which were of real help to me in my role within DFID and as Chair of the IATI TAG</em>.\\u201d</span></p><p>In 2013 Simon shifted his responsibilities to a broader leadership role within Development Initiatives, focussing more on the demand side of the information ecosystem, recognising that the IATI project will come to nothing unless the data is properly used. As recently as a month ago, over two years into his debilitating battle with cancer, Simon was analysing the challenges of mapping IATI data to the SDGs.</p><p>If you would like to share your memories of Simon, please do so on the IATI <a href=\\\"http://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/remembering-simon/512\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Discuss forum</a>. There is also a <a href=\\\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/simon-parrish\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">page on the DI website</a>\\u00a0where you can send a personal message to Chloe or make a donation to the hospice where Simon spent his last days.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

So if you\\u2019ve ever wondered whether someone\\u2019s data is up to date, or if you can see what their planned budgets are for 2018, here\\u2019s how!</span></p><p>Every night the Dashboard checks through everyone\\u2019s data and looks for changes so it can update itself, meaning that it\\u2019s an excellent real time barometer of how all publishers are doing on the four dimensions of good IATI data \\u2013 timeliness, forward-looking, comprehensiveness and coverage. Let\\u2019s look at what these mean in simple terms:</p><p><b>Timeliness</b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This is made up of two things:</span></p><ul>\\n<li><b><b>How often a publisher updates their data</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> (frequency)</span></b></li>\\n</ul><ul>\\n<li><b>How old the data is</b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> (time lag)</span></li>\\n</ul><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The </span><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Frequency table</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> on the Dashboard shows a column for each of the last twelve months and a figure to show how many days that publisher changed their transaction dates in each month. The last column shows an overall assessment of how often a publisher is updating their data, based on </span><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html#h_assesment\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">these criteria</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. You can sort the table by publisher name, overall frequency, or by month. There is a column for the current month but this is not included in the overall assessment. The same applies for </span><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness_timelag.html\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Time Lag</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.</span></p><p><b>Forward-looking</b></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Put simply, forward-looking information means whether the publisher has provided budgets for the current year and two subsequent years for their IATI activities.

Our mission is to empower governments, organisations, and individuals with the knowledge they need to improve lives.</span></p><p><b>Why is Development Gateway committed to transparency and more IATI data use?</b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">DG has participated in IATI since its inception, and sees transparency in development assistance as key for aid effectiveness. In particular, DG has worked with nearly 30 governments globally in developing Aid Information Management Systems (AIMS).</span></p><p><b>Tell us about your recent work on IATI data use in five countries</b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In January 2015, the DG team began work, with support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to better understand the value of using IATI data in country systems. The programme aimed to integrate the use of IATI data in the operational practices of partner country ministries of finance and planning via Aid Information Management Systems (AIMS). <span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Five countries that use</span><a href=\\\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/expertise/information-management/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> DG\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP)</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> agreed to participate in the study: </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Chad, Cote d\\u2019Ivoire, Madagascar, Senegal and\\u00a0Burkina Faso (the work programme in Burkina Faso was delayed due to political instability in the country during 2015).</span></span></p><p><b>What did you learn </b><b>from the project about IATI data use?</b></p><p><b><b>Countries had heard of, but never used IATI data</b></b><br/>\\nAt the beginning of the programme, the majority of government staff participants had heard of IATI, but most had never used IATI data before in their work.</p><p><img alt=\\\"Have you ever heard of IATI\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-3814 alignright\\\" height=\\\"302\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2.original.png\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2.original.png 997w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2-450x136.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2-768x233.png 768w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2-600x182.png 600w\\\" width=\\\"997\\\"/><b><b>IATI provides a huge amount of aid information previously unknown to governments</b></b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Typically, the import of selected IATI data resulted in the addition of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid flow data, which were previously \\u2018blind spots\\u2019 for the country governments. These largely included non-traditional actors, like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), and the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.</span></p><p><b><b>Using IATI data is challenging for governments</b></b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">At the end of the programme, government participants expressed greater awareness of and enthusiasm for IATI data; however, challenges still remain regarding the data and the governments\\u2019 capacity to use it. Unsurprisingly, one week of training was insufficient and the majority of participants still did not feel confident in using IATI within their country systems.</span></p><p><img alt=\\\"Is your knowledge of IATI improved\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-3817 alignleft\\\" height=\\\"184\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Is-your-knowledge-of-IATI-improved.original.png\\\" width=\\\"565\\\"/><b><b>Training, tools and publication in the official government language would help IATI use</b></b><br/>\\nWhen asked, government participants cited online tutorials and continuous training as their greatest needs, with improved IATI tools also important.

It is not surprising therefore that Bangladesh is keen to use IATI data to enhance its Aid Information Management System (AIMS).</p><p>As the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) uses a locally developed AIMS and owns the source code, they are able to flexibly and cheaply make whatever changes and improvements to the system they want. With the support of UNDP, they have contracted a great local IT company (<a href=\\\"http://www.technovista.com.bd/\\\">Technovista</a>) to develop a way to easily import IATI data to the AIMS.</p><p><strong>Getting good data is a challenge for all AIMS</strong><br/>\\nAIMS are important tools to capture information about development cooperation at a country level and are vital platforms for coordinating and overseeing activities funded and implemented by a large number of different actors. To do this they need basic data on the projects all actors are planning and implementing.</p><p>Manual data entry takes time and effort, and data quality suffers as a result. The increasing availability of IATI data is an opportunity to lower the burden of data entry and get higher quality data available for stakeholders in aid recipient countries to analyse.</p><p><strong>Challenges in using IATI data</strong><br/>\\nThere is now a<a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/news/busan-endorsers-significantly-improve-iati-data-quality\\\"> large amount of data published in IATI</a>. Given this, questions have been raised about the very limited use of IATI data in country systems. The lack of use has been a source of frustration for organisations that have invested considerable resources in IATI \\u00a0and in their own data publication. Our work in Bangladesh is identifying some of the difficulties faced by enthusiastic partner countries:</p><p><em>Complexity in the aid system</em>: Country level systems need to be able to handle the same project being reported by multiple organisations from different perspectives. Multiple reporting is encouraged in IATI as publishers provide data independently of each-other, and because a much wider range of organisations (including implementers) can publish. This complexity is inherent in the aid system \\u2013 where money is frequently\\u00a0pooled or passed around between organisations \\u2013 and there are significant benefits to having multiple reporters. However, in IATI the burden of coordination (removing double counting) is currently shifted downstream to the end users. If more publishers correctly used the traceability components of the IATI Standard this situation would improve. For the foreseeable future, AIMS that use IATI data will need to rely on humans \\u2013 particularly staff in donor country offices \\u2013 to interpret the data.</p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><em>Differing donor approaches to providing IATI data</em>: Data quality is not a precise term and varies wildly depending on the \\u2018for what/who\\u2019. At country level, key quality features are whether details such as the implementing agency is named, and translations given in the national language. Some donors publish data with aggregated financials or without grouping data into recognisable projects, or publish data too infrequently to be useful.</p><p>We will not be implementing any donor-specific \\u2018hacks\\u2019 to deal with these difficulties. Instead, we will contact donors and inform them of these problems, encouraging them to address them. There should be a strong business case here for donors to address these issues, as it should save a large amount of staff time from manually re-keying data that could otherwise be imported. The forthcoming publication of <a href=\\\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/2016-aid-transparency-index/\\\">Publish What You Fund\\u2019s 2016 Aid Transparency Index</a> should also help to focus minds on data quality.</p><p>Due to these challenges, IATI data doesn\\u2019t yet flow to recipient countries as smoothly as might be imagined. However, this will not prevent us from using the wealth of good data that <em>is</em> now available. Our solution is to build an interface to allow humans to make sensible decisions when importing IATI data, explaining how activities fit together, and at what level, to create meaningful projects, adding in missing data and clarifying that status of the data with in-country representatives as they go.</p><p><strong>Where we will get to by May</strong><br/>\\nWe have a very tight (and ambitious!) timescale for development, which must be complete within the next three months. By then, we aim to have developed an interface which can import data from any organisation publishing IATI data. Donors will continue to be responsible for reporting their projects to the Bangladeshi AIMS and it will be up to them to decide whether their IATI data is an accurate reflection of their activities or whether they prefer to use other data sources. We will provide tools to help them make these decisions.</p><p>We are also conscious of the opportunity to create some useful public goods out of this process. The software Technovista are developing is open source and openly licensed: it will continue to be published on <a href=\\\"http://github.com/bd-iati/edi\\\">Github\\u00a0</a>as we progress. The methodology, documentation, and development process is being recorded on a <a href=\\\"http://bd-iati.github.io\\\">microsite</a>. We are also using this platform to collect the issues we find in using donors\\u2019 data. This is useful for us to refer back to and point donors towards, but we hope it will also be a helpful resource for others working on importing IATI data to country systems in the future.</p><p><strong>Moving from data collection to aid effectiveness</strong><br/>\\n2016 can be the year that we demonstrate the power of IATI to reduce the burden of data collection, improve data quality and, ultimately, use the data to improve aid effectiveness. We\\u2019re working hard to make that possible at the country level, and we will be happy to be held accountable for delivering on our commitments at the IATI Members\\u2019 Assembly meeting in June.</p><p>We can only work with the data that\\u2019s available \\u2013 and some donors still need to catch up with the rest on the quality of data they are publishing. But with a wealth of good-quality data now out there, it really is time to start using the data that is available \\u2013 and rewarding those donors that have made progress with a lighter workload.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

My role is to coordinate bilateral and multilateral partners and develop sound policies and programmes for the management and procurement of external resources. </span></p><p><b>What are you views on aid transparency?</b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The Government of Liberia (GoL) is very committed to development cooperation transparency; for this reason it established the Aid Management and Coordination Unit. Since 2009, the Unit has been publishing ODA (Official Development Assistance) reports for Liberia with the help of other actors in the aid effectiveness environment, especially IATI.</span></p><p><b>When did you start using IATI data? </b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In my role, I started using IATI data in 2014 during the outbreak of the Ebola crisis in Liberia. After the President called the first meeting on the issue, we gathered IATI data related to Ebola and used it to monitor contributions and cross-check assistance with in-country offices on a case-by-case basis.</span></p><p><b>Why is IATI data useful in your work? </b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">IATI data is used to complement and complete my locally collected data. It is very helpful because it provides a realistic picture of most, if not all external resources available to Liberia. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">After downloading IATI data we align it with our development strategy and follow up with in-country office donors for validation and confirmation. With this verified data we are able to publish our official quarterly and annual ODA reports, which we share with many important stakeholders. For example, the Central Bank of Liberia, the Legislature and the Department of Budget and Macro-fiscal Unit at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning. </span></p><p><b>How else is IATI data used? </b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">IATI data supports the GoL in the preparation of its macroeconomic framework, national budget preparation and increases transparency and accountability of ODA to Liberia. The data also helps to inform the national Legislature about donors operating in their constituencies. </span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We also share our entire data set with Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) economists, as it supports the production of Liberia\\u2019s Balance of Payments.</span></p><p><b>Do you have any advice to countries considering using IATI data?</b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I recommend other countries use IATI data in the context of the aid data collection process. It helps to provide more realistic information and makes your analysis more credible. IATI data also provides an opportunity to find funding information about donors who are not stationed in your country, and provides a good basis to build communication links with them. I think it is advisable to always cross-check the data with donors on the ground before publication.</span></p><p><b>Do you have any difficulties using IATI data? </b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Not with the IATI system, but we could benefit from help to cross-check IATI data with donors that do not have an office in Liberia, as we require sign-off from all donors before we use or publish their data. \\u00a0</span></p><p><b>What are your future plans regarding IATI?</b><br/>\\n<span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The Government of Liberia is anticipating upgrading its Aid Management Platform (AMP) with the IATI import module, so that we can bring IATI data into our own systems and look at it alongside our existing data. We\\u2019re also engaging again as a member of IATI and participating in meetings of the initiative.</span></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Welcome announcements were made, including significant voluntary contributions for 2016-17 from the Hewlett Foundation and the European Commission, and new memberships, including the Republic of Korea and InterAction, with formal membership steps also expected soon for Guinea, FAO, WHO and UNIDO.</p><p>The <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/about/archive-/\\\">evaluation</a> of IATI undertaken in 2015 proved to be a good starting point for discussions. The excellent groundwork undertaken by the interim<a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/about/archive-/governance-archive//steering-committee-sub-groups\\\">\\u00a0Members\\u2019 Advisory Group</a> to prepare detailed recommendations around governance, strategic vision and hosting helped the Steering Committee to come to some concrete decisions at the meeting. Members agreed to establish a Governing Board representing donors, civil society, partner countries and the technical community. The Board will have responsibility for preparing recommendations for approval by the Members\\u2019 Assembly, which will meet annually and will contribute to decision-making between meetings through a virtual process. Members also agreed to ask the current\\u00a0IATI <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/who-runs-iati/\\\">Secretariat</a> to continue their work for a maximum of\\u00a0two further years\\u00a0beyond the current term (which would have expired in August 2016) and requested that the Board develop recommendations during this period for more permanent institutional arrangements for IATI.</p><p><img alt=\\\"SC_detail\\\" class=\\\" wp-image-3657 alignright\\\" height=\\\"177\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/SC_detail.original.jpg\\\" width=\\\"233\\\"/>Through the innovative use of online collaborative tools, the Secretariat was able to record the essence of facilitated conversations taking place around eleven small tables on topics such as IATI\\u2019s role\\u00a0in the 2030 agenda as a standard that can capture data on all international resources for development; those inputs were used as references in later plenary sessions.</p><p>When asked about the potential for rebranding IATI, members were keen on retaining the acronym whilst agreeing that IATI should lose the \\u2018Aid\\u2019 word in order to promote greater inclusivity and reflect its potential to capture data on all international resources. The Board was asked to establish a process for looking in more depth at the question of branding while\\u00a0it also considers\\u00a0the\\u00a0longer term vision for IATI.</p><p>The technical team shared highlights from the new <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/news/iati-upgrade-to-version-2-02-goes-live\\\">upgrade to version 2.02</a> of the Standard which went live on December 7, following a rigorous process of consultation ahead of the meetings. This makes the Standard fit for purpose for the humanitarian community, adding new optional fields, and enabling publishers to report data in real time via a humanitarian marker for fast-tracking publication of humanitarian activities. With v2.02 all publishers\\u00a0are now able to report progress against the\\u00a0Sustainable Development Goals, with goals and targets already incorporated and a placeholder for indicators once these are agreed. These new fields give IATI an important edge in terms of monitoring SDG activity at country level and members are encouraged to use the new fields as early as possible.</p><p>In discussions on the Transparency Indicator of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC), members gave support for the <a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/transparencyindicator.html\\\">methodology and assessment</a> of IATI data through the <a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/\\\">Dashboard</a> which now includes the dimensions of <a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html\\\">timeliness</a>, <a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness.html\\\">comprehensiveness</a> and <a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/forwardlooking.html\\\">forward-looking</a> as highlighted in the Busan transparency commitment. Members were concerned that, while the GPEDC Joint Support Team\\u2019s proposal for combining the IATI component with the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and Forward Spending Survey (FSS) may be technically sound, it is overly complex and therefore of limited political value in encouraging donors to improve their transparency.</p><p>IATI was pleased to launch its latest <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/annual-reports/\\\">Annual Report</a>\\u00a0which contains several excellent case studies from publishers and users of IATI data. The report is available\\u00a0in English, with executive summaries in French and Spanish.</p><p>Given the short timeline for establishing the new governance structures ahead of the next meeting of members in June 2016 (TBC), the Chair asked the interim Members\\u2019 Advisory Group (MAG) to continue its work and encouraged other members to volunteer to assist the MAG in some of its workstreams on implementing the new governance structures, developing IATI\\u2019s strategic vision, improving data use at country level and moving towards permanent hosting arrangements.</p><p><img alt=\\\"Robin Uyterlinde\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3655\\\" height=\\\"354\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Robin-Uyterlinde.original.jpg\\\" width=\\\"232\\\"/><span style=\\\"font-weight: 300;\\\">Finally, members bid farewell and gave warm thanks to the Steering Committee Chair, Robin Uyterlinde, who has completed his two year tenure. He was happy to leave IATI on such a high note and remarked on some of the excellent advances that have taken place during </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 300;\\\">his time in the role,</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 300;\\\">\\u00a0including the </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 300;\\\">growth</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 300;\\\">\\u00a0to more than 360 publishers reflecting more than US$78bn of development resources reported through IATI.

In 2015, the need for joined-up conversations has intensified as a result of the exciting policy developments taking place at the international level. Within the context of the renewal of the international development agenda and the setting of the <a href=\\\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\\\">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs), a rare phenomenon has occurred \\u2013 a multi-stakeholder consensus across public policy and open data communities has emerged \\u2013 recognising a need not just for more and better data generation but for the creation of <em>better</em> <em>information </em>to drive policy-making and accountability efforts in future.</p><p>Joining-up existing open data standards across policy sectors is only one small component of broader efforts to create better information, but it is a key component. Its value has been acknowledged at the highest levels of the international development community and the need for interoperability is recognised within the <a href=\\\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/07/Addis-Ababa-Action-Agenda-Draft-Outcome-Document-7-July-2015.pdf\\\">Addis Ababa Action Agenda</a> (AAAA) (para. 128). Moreover, within the broader context of the <a href=\\\"http://www.undatarevolution.org/\\\">Data Revolution</a>, the need to ensure interoperability and compatibility between data standards has been enshrined as a fundamental open data principle within the new <a href=\\\"http://opendatacharter.net/\\\">International Open Data Charter</a> (IODC) (Principle 4).</p><p>Translating these principles into a more practical example at last week\\u2019s event, Georg framed the value of joined-up data as being, \\u201crelevant to so many of the SDGs in helping us to follow the money through contracts, aid and budgets\\u201d. Linked to this example, Beata Lisowska, a Data Scientist at Development Initiatives working on joined-up data standards, has recently mapped the relationship between sector definitions within the <a href=\\\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=4\\\">classification of functions of government</a> (COFOG) standard, used by the UN system, and the <a href=\\\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1\\\">creditor reporting system</a> (CRS), used by the OECD. Excitingly, this cross-mapping, if linked to SDG indicators, could eventually be used as a tool to estimate whether or not SDG goals are being sufficiently funded.</p><p>Now that consensus on the <em>need</em> has been achieved, it is crucial that conversations across interest-groups and policy sectors are joined-up to generate consensus on <em>how</em> interoperability can be achieved. As Conrad put it, \\u201cwe want to be able to translate between existing standards to make data comparable and speak the same language in key areas \\u2013 i.e. to make data interoperable\\u201d. This implies that standard setters, data producers and users all have to take part in the same conversation. Reflecting on her own experiences, Ania commented that, \\u201cin Mexico, we partnered national statistics institutions and the open data community to help join-up data\\u201d. This is no mean feat given the divergence in methodologies, objectives and incentives that exist, even within a single government. The politics inherent to joining-up data standards was identified almost immediately at the event, and one of the very first questions from the audience was, \\u201chow do you overcome politics to join-up data standards?\\u201d In answering the question, Rupert pointed out that the only way to do this is to, \\u201cbuild a coalition of parties who gain from interoperability\\u201d. Achieving this will require fostering a new global consensus.</p><p>The recognition of the need for interoperable data standards within the IODC and the AAAA offers intergovernmental and multilateral bodies, individual governments, corporate bodies and civil society organisations a unique opportunity to join-up their conversations. As Martin so eloquently put it, \\u201cdata sings when it is joined-up\\u201d. The challenge moving forward then is for open data standard setters, producers and users to put their voices together to make the data sing.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Since <a href=\\\"https://www.interaction.org/blog/lessons-road-transparency-four-tips-publishing-iati\\\">first publishing in March 2015</a>, we\\u2019ve considerably improved our publication process. It\\u2019s only a slight exaggeration to say that we can now publish to IATI with just one click of a button. In case it might be of use to others, here\\u2019s how we did it.</p><p>Though the process we set up to publish the first and second time certainly got the job done, it was far from efficient. This is what it looked like (individuals involved are in italics and tools in bold blue text):</p><p><img alt=\\\"old_iati_process\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3542\\\" height=\\\"271\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/old_iati_process.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/old_iati_process.jpg 621w, https://www.iatistandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/old_iati_process-450x196.jpg 450w, https://www.iatistandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/old_iati_process-600x262.jpg 600w\\\" width=\\\"621\\\"/></p><p>Some might fairly ask why we didn\\u2019t just use <a href=\\\"http://www.aidstream.org/\\\">AidStream</a>, a tool that would have allowed us to simply enter our grant information and then publish to IATI directly. The most important reason is that we needed this grant data for our own internal purposes. Using AidStream as a grant management tool was not an option because we capture additional data on grants beyond what is covered by IATI. We also didn\\u2019t want to make grant managers manually enter data in two places: the grant forms and AidStream. So although this process did take some time to set up, in the short-term it was slightly more efficient than the alternatives.</p><p>Even at the time, however, we knew this process would not be sustainable. And indeed, once our resource development manager left \\u2013 which meant their role in the process fell to the IATI lead \\u2013 we made it a priority to streamline the process.</p><p>Around this time, we learned that we could make use of the Salesforce database InterAction has been transitioning to. Working with our IT director and another tech-savvy colleague, we created a more comprehensive version of the grant form in Salesforce using the \\u201cOpportunities\\u201d functionality. This is what our process looks like now:</p><p><img alt=\\\"new_iati_process\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-3543 aligncenter\\\" height=\\\"112\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/new_iati_process.jpg\\\" width=\\\"439\\\"/></p><p>We are thrilled to have gotten to this point. Though we will continue making tweaks, the process is now so simple that anyone at InterAction could conceivably serve as the \\u201cIATI lead.\\u201d In other words, InterAction\\u2019s publication to IATI is no longer dependent on the expertise of one or two people.</p><p>As happy as we are to have gotten here, the process was admittedly painful. Making sense of what IATI requires was much more time consuming than it should have been. Setting things up in Salesforce was similarly difficult and complicated. Fortunately, that actually had an upside: after struggling unsuccessfully to get Salesforce to generate a file with all the grant information we needed for IATI, my colleague discovered he could just write a code that would generate an IATI XML file (for those who\\u2019d like to see this code, visit <a href=\\\"https://github.com/InteractionNGO/publishing-iati-data-with-salesforce\\\">this GitHub page</a>). This breakthrough allowed us to simplify the publication process even more than we\\u2019d hoped, as we no longer need to use the <a href=\\\"http://csv2iati.iatistandard.org/docs/user_guide.html\\\">IATI2CSV converter</a>.</p><p>Based on our experience, we\\u2019d like to offer the IATI community two recommendations:</p><ul>\\n<li><strong>For the IATI Secretariat</strong>: Invest in improving the guidance for publishing to IATI. As it is, publishing to IATI remains a daunting task, turning off many who might be willing to publish voluntarily.</li>\\n<li><strong>For IATI publishers</strong>: Don\\u2019t just write about why you\\u2019re publishing to IATI, but also <em>how</em>. This will help others trying to figure out their own process, and make it possible to identify pain points that new tools or changes to existing tools could help solve.</li>\\n</ul>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

We believe that joining-up data on aid, contracts, budgets, humanitarian assistance and other development-related data offers an exciting new frontier for open data and its ability to support efforts to tackle global development issues. Through the JDA, IATI can work with other data standard communities, to encourage user-centric design in the creation of standards and share common methodologies and coding systems in fields such as geospatial data, functional sectors and organisational, corporate and demographic identifiers.</p><p>Collaboration on areas such as these can mean that data is more comparable across different standards. This could enable easier tracing of, for example development cooperation flows, following them from donors, through implementing partners, to recipient governments and procurement systems, and even down to the beneficiary level.</p><p>Momentum is building in the area of joined-up data with the second launch of <a href=\\\"http://opendatacharter.net/\\\">International Open Data Charter</a> in Mexico this week. The Charter offers a way to join up silos of disconnected data on resource flows and socio-economic indicators, highlighting that: \\u201cWhen\\u00a0data can be effectively combined and compared, it can help highlight trends, identify\\u00a0social and economic challenges and inequities, and benchmark progress in public\\u00a0programs and services\\u201d.</p><p>Under principle four of the charter, signatories pledge to \\u201cengage with domestic and international standards bodies and other standard setting\\u00a0initiatives to encourage increased interoperability between existing\\u00a0international standards, support the creation of common, global data standards\\u00a0where they do not already exist, and ensure that any new data standards we create\\u00a0are, to the greatest extent possible, interoperable with existing standards\\u201d.</p><div class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_3533\\\" style=\\\"width: 505px\\\"><a href=\\\"http://opendatacharter.net/\\\"><img alt=\\\"Open Data Charter Principles\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-3533\\\" height=\\\"158\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Open-Data-Charter-Principles-450x136.original.jpg\\\" width=\\\"495\\\"/></a><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">The principles of the Open Data Charter (Source: www.opendatacharter.net/)</p></div><p>IATI is excited to be part of increased international efforts to bring together data standards in an effort to enable more effective use of data.

Supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\\u2019s (DFAT) <a href=\\\"https://innovationxchange.dfat.gov.au/\\\">innovationxchange</a>, the project will seek to support better monitoring and evaluation of nutrition programmes.</p><p>This is a really exciting and novel use of the IATI Standard to track aid program outcomes, and is welcomed by the IATI Secretariat as a positive step forward in the use of IATI data. We spoke to <a href=\\\"http://www.catalpa.io/about_us.html\\\">David Roach</a>, Catalpa International Director and Co-Founder, about the project.</p><p><strong>What are the plans for the project so far?</strong></p><p>The plan is to provide a monitoring and evaluation system to better address the issue of malnutrition, by making it easier for programme implementers to report activities, expenditure and results directly to DFAT in an IATI compliant format. Catalpa will deploy our \\u2018Openly\\u2019 Open Data Information Management software as the backbone of this system. Openly is already being used in <a href=\\\"http://www.catalpa.io/project_feature_mohinga.html\\\">Myanmar</a> to track donor aid flows with great success.</p><p>Malnutrition in Timor-Leste is a major concern, with 50 per cent of children under five years experiencing stunting \\u2013 one of the highest rates globally. We\\u2019ve been based in Timor-Leste for close to eight years and have seen the impact malnutrition has on Timor\\u2019s overall development. When the opportunity came up to build on our existing partnership with DFAT, we jumped at the chance to help make a positive impact in the communities in which we work.</p><p><strong>How do you hope to use the results information?</strong></p><p>Firstly, we\\u2019re going to use the <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/\\\">IATI Standard</a> to coordinate the collection of activity results across partners. Partners from a number of sectors will be working under a shared monitoring and evaluation framework, reporting all their activity outcomes online. At Catalpa, we\\u2019ll be aggregating this results data across all of the partners and tracking their collective progress in as near real-time as possible.</p><p>The second part of the project will use mobile technology to gather information around impact, for such things as anaemia levels and under-nutrition, so that DFAT and its implementing partners will be able to see how activity outcomes are influencing nutrition rates.</p><p>We will be also exploring the use of biometrics to collect results over smart-phones, and other technology to simplify and improve the quality of data collected in a low resource settings.</p><p><strong>Will the data be made publicly available? </strong></p><p>Yes, this is one of the reasons why we are so excited about the project. Over time we will be working with DFAT to create a series of interactive, publicly accessible dashboards and other online tools, so partners and the general public will be able to track the same information as DFAT staff in Dili and Canberra.</p><p><strong>What do you hope the benefits of this project will be to DFAT, its implementing partners, and citizens of Timor-Leste in general? </strong></p><p>For DFAT, this is an opportunity to support greater coordination among their implementing partners and provide a stronger focus on assessing the effectiveness of aid programmes in a more efficient manner. At the same time, it allows DFAT to connect with implementing partners in a simpler way, as well as fulfilling their international obligations to increasing aid transparency.</p><p>For the implementing partners, this will hopefully streamline reporting requirements and allow them to devote resources to achieving results and better value for money for the donor. The idea is that when data is open and shareable across DFATs implementing partners, it can be aggregated together to promote better analysis, leading to more efficient and effective allocation of effort and resources.</p><p>And for the citizens of Timor-Leste, we think this will be one of, if not the first, aid activity that is monitored in real time in a public way. As access to the internet and mobile phones increases, not just in Dili but throughout rural areas, we think there will be a greater demand for this type of initiative.</p><p><strong><em>For further information on Catalpa and their projects you can visit their </em></strong><a href=\\\"http://www.catalpa.io/\\\">website</a><strong><em>.

While you can access Oxfam Novib\\u2019s data from the <a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org\\\">IATI registry</a>, this raw, open data can be difficult to read and use. With ATLAS, the raw information is placed into context, making it more attractive and useful. This allows sponsors, journalists, partners and others to see how the money is being spent, and even compare Oxfam Novib\\u2019s work with that of other development organisations through tools such as <a href=\\\"http://www.openaid.nl/\\\">openaid.nl</a>, which are also driven by IATI data.</p><p>Internally, and among partners, the data in ATLAS is an essential learning and knowledge sharing tool. ATLAS doesn\\u2019t only show Oxfam\\u2019s successes, but also those projects that may not have gone as planned. \\u201cThis is what open data means, everything is public,\\u201d says Leo. \\u201cThat is scary in the beginning, but eventually it will make us better at what we do. It forces us to be critical and improve things that don\\u2019t work.\\u201d Furthermore, it can enable essential knowledge sharing between partners working on the same issues and projects in and across countries. Searching ATLAS to find comparable projects means partner organisations can join forces and share knowledge proactively.</p><p>Leo also notes that publishing to IATI and developing ATLAS has encouraged the organisation to think more about the data they are entering into their project administration systems: poor data in, poor data out; \\u201cHopefully, Atlas inspires project teams to register their projects properly.\\u201d The Oxfam Novib website also <a href=\\\"http://www.oxfamnovib.nl/Open-Data.html\\\">encourages users to provide feedback</a> on the datasets they access, so that they can be improved.</p><p>This isn\\u2019t the final step for Oxfam Novib: the ATLAS team are already working on a new version that will be accessible on mobile devices, which will enable users to access data anywhere, at any time. Other Oxfam affiliates will also be including their data in ATLAS in the coming months, with Oxfam GB and Oxfam India following in the steps of their Dutch colleagues in making their IATI data more accessible, and easy to use.

This phase improved USAID\\u2019s reporting on 15 IATI data elements, increasing USAID\\u2019s reporting to cover 54 percent of IATI data elements including providing links to organizational level files and reporting additional fields such as conditions, type of finance, and status of the activity.</li>\\n<li><strong>Phase Two</strong> will add or improve data on seven IATI elements including links to impact appraisals, evaluations, and in-language activity titles and descriptions. It will also streamline reporting by replacing the existing manual and labour-intensive spreadsheet-based system with an automated process for assembling IATI data. This is expected to create time savings for the extraction of data, and will increase USAID\\u2019s reporting to include 64 percent of IATI data elements.</li>\\n<li><strong>Phase Three </strong>will add or improve data on four IATI indicators that show sub-national geographic data, objectives, contact details, and activity websites, and improve the management of the redaction process that ensures protection of sensitive information. It will also result in USAID producing its own XML reporting files, and will increase USAID\\u2019s reporting to include 70 percent of IATI data elements.</li>\\n<li><strong>Phase Four, which was not approved but deferred, </strong>will add or improve reporting on eight IATI indicators that include results, latitude/longitude coordinates, tenders, and policy markers.

Further, in 2014, the<a href=\\\"http://ati.publishwhatyoufund.org/\\\"> Aid Transparency Index</a> ranked Romania 39<sup>th</sup> out of 50 bilateral organisations (with a score of 10.6%), despite measures taken to improve communication of results. The unsatisfactory ranking called for decisive action and motivated us to start publishing data to the IATI Standard, and improve our performance.</p><p><strong>What tools and processes did you use to publish to the IATI Standard? </strong></p><p>We published data to the IATI Standard through the EU-DEVFIN database, a tool that promotes transparency in official development assistance (ODA) reporting among EU member states, and contributes to the fulfilment of Busan commitments. The MFA EU-DEVFIN data is based on Romania\\u2019s yearly ODA reporting. This tool has not only helped us to enhance the quality of our data \\u2013 a precondition for transparency \\u2013 but also provided us with a fairly simple method of producing the IATI data, since EU-DEVFIN can convert data into the IATI Standard format.</p><p><strong>What were some of the challenges that you found in publishing data to the IATI Standard, and how did you overcome them? </strong></p><p>The main challenge we encountered was coordinating all the national public institutions to use the EU-DEVFIN reporting system. To manage this efficiently, we organised training and other activities to raise awareness of the importance of the reporting process, and implemented a communication system with each public institution\\u2019s contact point.\\u00a0 From a technical point of view, the EU-DEVFIN produces some errors when exporting IATI files. Here, the support of the IATI technical team was crucial in taking all the necessary steps for overcoming these errors and publishing our data. We are now in the process of improving EU-DEVFIN and repairing the IATI file export function, to make it smoother for future publication.</p><p><strong>What are the potential benefits that publishing open data will bring to your work? </strong></p><p>Publishing information on aid flows in a common, comparable format adds great value to our activities. First, by helping us to better communicate our results to the general public, since the IATI Standard enables us to publish comparable data that is easier to analyse and is more reliable. Secondly, Romania wishes to be an effective and key player in the international development arena, and publishing open data increases the visibility of our results, at national and international levels. Finally, publishing open data increases citizens\\u2019 support and trust in our work: citizens\\u2019 support allows us to further improve and consolidate Romania\\u2019s development cooperation programme, making our work more effective.</p><p><strong>Do you have any advice for other governments or organisations considering using IATI?</strong></p><p>Our main advice to other governments and organisations is to set IATI publication as a core objective, and plan to deliver it using existing tools, systems and technical processes. EU-DEVFIN can be useful for governments who are considering creating their own databases, as the software is open source and it is able to produce IATI formatted data.</p><p><strong>If your organisation is interested in exploring how to publish data to the IATI Standard, using the EU-DEVFIN database or other technical tools, get in touch with the IATI Technical Team <a href=\\\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\\\">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</strong></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Version 2.01 was <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/news/steering-committee-approves-version-2-01-of-the-iati-standard\\\">approved by the Steering Committee</a> in October 2014 including changes to organisation identifiers, the number of mandatory fields and improvements to the reporting of free text fields.</p><p>We asked Horia Sohir Debbiche, IATI and Aidflows Programme Coordinator at the AfDB, about their experience of implementing 2.01.</p><p><strong>Why did AfDB decide to use version 2.01? </strong></p><p>The AfDB has a long standing <a href=\\\"http://devcooperation.org/2014/10/08/transparency-at-the-heart-of-africas-growth-and-prosperity/\\\">commitment to transparency</a>, and this includes publishing to IATI. We are always striving to keep this commitment proactive, for example through being one of the first multilateral development banks to <a href=\\\"http://mapafrica.afdb.org/\\\">publish geolocation data</a>. For AfDB, IATI is not only about reporting, but also making the data more comparable and user-friendly. The AfDB <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/news/african-development-bank-publishes-to-iati\\\">first published</a> to IATI in June 2013 and we wanted to show that it was possible to progress and achieve results quickly. When version 2.01 became available the upgrade was a natural move, opening up new opportunities and enabling us to enhance the quality of our data.</p><p><strong>What was the transition process like?</strong></p><p>The process was quite easy, with clear steps to be followed: updating templates, adding new mapping, and deleting unnecessary elements. We used the <a href=\\\"http://validator.iatistandard.org/\\\">IATI validator tool</a> to make sure that we had covered all the issues, and were in regular consultation with the <a href=\\\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\\\">IATI technical team</a> for advice and support.</p><p><strong>What were the greatest challenges, and how did you overcome them?</strong></p><p>One of the greatest challenges was to get all the team on board. To ensure this, we collaborated extensively with our IT team to ensure we all understood exactly what had to be added, deleted and reordered. Another more specific challenge for us was upgrading the <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/location/\\\">geocoded data</a>, as we were starting from version 1.03 for this part of the Standard. Again, support from <a href=\\\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/\\\">Development Gateway</a> and the IATI technical team allowed us to deal with more complicated issues.</p><p>Being amongst the first publishers to upgrade to version 2.01, we did face some challenges, as it was somewhat a journey of discovery. However, great collaboration both internally and externally allowed for a smooth process.</p><div class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\" id=\\\"attachment_3384\\\" style=\\\"width: 558px\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Map-Africa-Screenshot.original.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"Map Africa Screenshot\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-3384 \\\" height=\\\"323\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Map-Africa-Screenshot-450x265.original.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Map-Africa-Screenshot-450x265.original.jpg 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Map-Africa-Screenshot-600x353.jpg 600w, https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/Map-Africa-Screenshot.original.jpg 1042w\\\" width=\\\"548\\\"/></a><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">MapAfrica \\u2013 the AfDB\\u2019s interactive platform that maps the location of their investments</p></div><p><strong>What would you say is the greatest advantage of this version compared to prior versions?</strong></p><p>2.01 adds more rigour to the Standard and allows publishers to provide better quality data. Certain fields are now available that better contextualise and enrich the data, and using codes for some elements makes language more neutral. Overall this means that data is more comparable and, leading on from that, more user-friendly.</p><p><strong>Do you have any advice for other publishers considering the transition to 2.01?</strong></p><p>Transitioning to the new version is just part of the process of publishing to IATI. All the <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/201/upgrades/integer-upgrade-to-2-01/2-01-headlines/\\\">guidance is available online </a>and the IATI technical team is always available to advise and look at your data. The IATI validator tool is also important, as you can check whether your data files are valid against the <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/201/schema/\\\">2.01 schema</a>. If you are currently publishing using versions 1.04 or 1.05, it is really just a matter of redefining the template you use and doing a new mapping to the updated standard.</p><p>As publishers of IATI data, we need to make data easier to use and compare for users. As a key step in enabling users to gain more from IATI data, all publishers should move towards upgrading to 2.01.</p><p><em>If you are interested in upgrading to version 2.01 of the IATI Standard and would like some support, get in touch with the IATI Technical Team </em><a href=\\\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\\\"><em>support@iatistandard.org</em></a></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Today, <strong>Marc Schublin, Director of Corporate Responsibility for the European Investment Bank</strong>, describes how the EIB publishes timely data to IATI.</em></p><p>As the EU Bank, the European Investment Bank lends annually around EUR 7bn for public and private sector investment in developing countries outside the EU. Our investments support private sector growth, the shift towards low-carbon, climate-resilient pathways, and the development of strategic infrastructure. These all contribute to poverty alleviation and economic revitalization.</p><p>We have decided to join IATI as we are convinced about the benefits that transparency can bring to aid and development finance and how openness can help in achieving global development objectives.</p><p>Publishing to IATI has made us consider how we can better present our data and projects on our website, and how we can interlink the different online tools that contain project information and documents. IATI has also played a positive role in data quality and general awareness about transparency among our staff. The number of downloads of our IATI files has also increased constantly since we started publishing, which demonstrates that our data is being used and our operations have thus become more visible.</p><p>The EIB is both a bank and a public body. Given this dual character, being transparent about how we make decisions, work and implement EU policies strengthens our credibility and accountability to citizens. Transparency also contributes to increasing the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of our operations, reinforcing our zero-tolerance stance on fraud and corruption, ensuring adherence to environmental and social standards linked to financed projects, and promoting accountability and good governance.</p><p>We have just reviewed our transparency policy, following an extensive public consultation process. Our new Policy continues to commit us to the highest standards of transparency in our day-to-day work and now also includes a specific reference to IATI.</p><p><img alt=\\\"EIB_EU_SLOGAN_A_French_4c\\\" class=\\\"alignright wp-image-3280\\\" height=\\\"154\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/EIB-logo-450x201.original.jpg\\\" width=\\\"331\\\"/>As a financial institution that often works with private sector clients in a development context, the EIB has a different business model and way of operating compared to traditional aid agencies. The biggest challenge we faced was the fact that IATI and the reporting standard were initially not designed for our type of institution. Before publishing, therefore, we worked very closely with the IATI Secretariat and a group of other development finance institutions to put in place guidelines specifically for organizations within the financial sector.</p><p>In parallel and internally, we prepared the ground from a technical point of view, setting up the necessary systems, assessing data availability and defining the related procedures for publishing.</p><p>Our signing up and publishing to IATI has been received very positively across the board by our partners and stakeholders. It has also enhanced our cooperation with other institutions in the EU family on issues regarding development transparency. We have already been asked for advice by a number of fellow financial institutions that also work with private sector clients in development, and that are interested in associating themselves with IATI.</p><p>IATI publication cannot be achieved overnight. There are up-front resources needed, transparency does not come for free, and one needs people and systems to have something like IATI successfully up and running. But this investment pays off in the long run \\u2013 after only half a year of IATI publication we can already see that IATI reporting can be very cost-efficient. We have deliberately decided to automate our IATI publication as much as possible, which allows us to reduce the workload to a minimum.</p><p>We considered the publication of timely data of key importance from the very beginning. Accordingly, we have educated our staff that the data they put into our systems will appear online shortly after, without any manual changes. Automating this process has helped us in making updated IATI data available on a monthly basis.</p><p>We hope that IATI will continue to be open and flexible concerning non-traditional actors in development cooperation. The landscape of development finance is changing, and an initiative like IATI can play an important role in allowing different types of stakeholders to associate themselves with the global openness and transparency agenda.</p><p>We would also like to see increased usage of IATI data by partner countries.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Their funds are invested via a group of subsidiary companies which offer customized specialist financing and project development expertise to get infrastructure initiatives off the ground.</p><p>Our investments are targeted at some of the poorest countries and most fragile states in the world and are expected to deliver significant development impact \\u2013 for example, mobilizing investment, improving access to infrastructure, and creating jobs. Being able to demonstrate the impact of our investments and the projects they support has always been important to PIDG and our Members.</p><p>PIDG monitoring and evaluation systems are continuously evolving to set and reflect best practice, and results are published on our website. Publishing on the IATI Registry is another important means by which we can demonstrate PIDG\\u2019s ongoing commitment to transparency and accountability.</p><p>When we began our journey towards IATI-compliant reporting 18 months ago, we realized that PIDG, like other similar DFIs and IFIs working extensively with private sector counterparts, had different business models and practices as compared to traditional development cooperation and grant aid providers. Rather than proceeding on the basis of individual exclusion policies, a group of DFIs (including PIDG), led by IATI\\u2019s Technical Team at Development Initiatives, worked together to arrive at a common understanding of how we could publish to IATI. This has resulted in PIDG publishing our first IATI-compliant reporting to the IATI Registry: we are committed to publishing and updating our information on a quarterly basis.</p><p>We believe that IATI makes it easier for our Members taxpayers to see how we have utilized funds and the projects that have been supported. Publishing to the IATI Registry reaffirms and reflects PIDG\\u2019s commitment to enhance transparency about its activities, improve development effectiveness, promote good governance and build public confidence.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Without high-quality data providing the right information on the right things at the right time, designing, monitoring and evaluating effective policies becomes almost impossible</em>.\\u201d</p><p>The IATI Secretariat welcomes the emphasis in the recent Independent Expert Advisory Group\\u2019s report on the importance of global standards and principles to underpin the data revolution. In its first recommendation, the IEAG calls for the development of a global consensus on principles and standards: <em>\\u201cThe disparate worlds of public, private and civil society data and statistics providers need to be urgently brought together to build trust and confidence among data users. We propose that the UN establish a process whereby key stakeholders create a \\u201cGlobal Consensus on Data\\u201d, to adopt principles concerning legal, technical, privacy, geospatial and statistical standards which, among other things, will facilitate openness and information exchange and promote and protect human rights.\\u201d </em></p><p>As a UN-led, multi-stakeholder initiative that has already developed a global open data standard for the publication of information on development cooperation, IATI can make a valuable contribution to this effort.</p><p>Many of the key issues identified in the IEAG report are ones that IATI seeks to address, such as ensuring data quality, usability and timeliness. As the report notes, <em>\\u201cGood data are relevant, accurate, timely, accessible, comparable and produced free of political\\u00a0interferences.\\u201d </em>IATI\\u2019s learning and experience over the past six years could provide useful insights for future work on this agenda.</p><p>The report further recognises that <em>\\u201c[c]omparability and standardisation are crucial as they allow data from different sources or time periods to be combined, and the more data can be combined, the more useful they are\\u201d. </em>This, too, is very much in line with IATI\\u2019s vision.</p><p>But while global standards can play an important role in helping to guide quality and direction, it is <em>\\u201cstrengthening national capacities that will be the essential test of any data revolution\\u201d,</em> as the report acknowledges. The same is true for IATI: its ultimate success will be judged on its ability to provide decision-makers at national and sub-national level with the timely, comprehensive and forward-looking data they need on development cooperation to make well-informed decisions, as well as the information required by others to hold those decision-makers to account.</p><p>The real gains will be achieved when IATI data can be easily combined with national-level data to maximise impact \\u2013 for example, with regard to capturing results. As this <a href=\\\"http://devinit.org/donors-results-iati-data-revolution/\\\">blog</a> from IATI\\u2019s Technical Lead sets out, <em>\\u201c[i]f top-down data on inputs and outputs from development activities could be joined up with bottom-up impact data collected through the national statistical system, development effectiveness would take a great leap forward.\\u201d </em></p><p>All IATI stakeholders have an important contribution to make towards a true data revolution for sustainable development. Donors can geo-code data on their activities to the IATI Standard and release structured data on their outputs; partner countries can invest in improved data collection by national statistics systems; and civil society should continue to demand high-quality open data, and use it to hold decision-makers accountable.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Common standards offer more value because they help data use.</p><p>Robin Uyterlinde, Chair of the IATI Steering Committee, gave a brief overview of the initiative, and emphasised that it was designed to meet the needs of users of information, rather than providers. He outlined the multi-stakeholder nature of IATI, and the range of different actors <a href=\\\"http://www.iatiregistry.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">publishing</a> to the IATI <a href=\\\"http://www.iatistandard.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Standard</a>.

He emphasised that while the IATI Standard has a solid core, it also has flexibility to accommodate the different needs\\u00a0 of different actors. He said that IATI was keen to work with any emerging donors who are interested in engaging with us.</p><p>From <a href=\\\"http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?country=MG&amp;tongue=eng#view=main\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Madagascar</a>, Zefania Romalahy spoke about his county\\u2019s efforts to encourage donors to provide information for their AIMS, which is available online. This information is vital in reporting back to citizens on who provides development cooperation and what it is spent on. It is important to have information from emerging actors in the same dashboard in order to present a complete picture. He noted that not all South-South Cooperation can be quantified, and this creates a challenge \\u2013 existing mechanisms may need to be adapted to deal with this.</p><p>As a concrete outcome of the round table, IATI proposed a technical workshop to explore how existing tools and technologies like IATI could be adapted to capture the contributions of emerging actors.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

The OGP and the Global Partnership share common interests in supporting CSO engagement, strengthening institutions and promoting open access to information.</p><p>The session explored how these concepts can be applied to development cooperation in order to improve effectiveness in poverty eradication and enhance efforts that are responsive to the true needs of beneficiaries. In this discussion, the role of open data, citizen empowerment and effective institutions was explored with transparency as a common thread, not only on strategy and resource allocation, but also on impact in both donor and recipient countries.</p><p>Key outcomes from the session are as follows:</p><ol>\\n<li><strong>Publishing good quality data in an open format is essential to development cooperation effectiveness and accountability</strong>:\\u00a0The session highlighted that data is a key component of decision-making processes in development cooperation and, therefore, having timely, forward-looking and comprehensive data is crucial to making the right decisions. Access to good quality data that allows stakeholders to monitor how development cooperation is allocated can lead to more effective coordination of efforts and can ensure accountability for donors and beneficiaries.\\u00a0 To truly tap into the potential value of data, it is essential that it is published in an open format and made available to citizens in an accessible manner. The widespread availability and use of good quality data can lead to improved development efforts, and can empower governments, donors, and citizens to collaborate towards maximising development impact.</li>\\n<li><strong>Transparency is a fundamental basis for enhancing development cooperation</strong>:<b> </b>The discussion conveyed the importance of transparency as a crucial ingredient for dialogue on the effectiveness of development cooperation. The session focused on the need to foster a culture of transparency by ensuring political will, capacity building and incentives to encourage and institutionalise transparency. Furthermore, the session called for a more direct linkage between transparency and development results with a strong focus on documentation. In this regard, the IATI standard serves as a model of how transparency, added to political will, technical capability, and civic engagement can lead to improved development outcomes.</li>\\n<li><strong>The OGP serves as a valuable space for collaboration between citizens and governments</strong>: Transparency and civic engagement are at the heart of the transition from aid assistance towards development cooperation. The former implies that donors and governments measure, understand and respond to the needs of aid recipients. Development for cooperation should begin from the standpoint that citizens can be active agents of their own development. In this sense, empowering citizens and providing them with access to information is crucial. This is at the heart of the theory of change of OGP; there is no cooperation without co-creation.</li>\\n</ol><p>OGP creates a space in which public reformers can sit at the same table in a constructive environment to co-create new ways of resolving public problems. Reformers inside and outside of the government structures need to work together effectively to bring about positive transformations in the lives of citizens around the world.</p><p>Overall, the session acknowledged the need to make development cooperation transparent and accessible to citizens, both from donor countries in terms of distribution, and from beneficiaries on feedback regarding the allocation and impact of development efforts. Transparency, open government and open data are powerful instruments to promote accountability and are essential to building trust and effective collaboration among governments, citizens and international organisations.</p><p>\\u00a0</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

The Global Partnership Monitoring Report confirmed that it is possible for donors to publish good quality, timely, comprehensive and forward-looking data as some, such as the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden, are already doing.</p><p>From the platform,\\u00a0 Klaus Rudischhauser, Deputy Director General, <a href=\\\"http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/index_en.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">EuropeAid</a> said that the EU already publishes details of over 8,000 projects (87% of the total) to IATI, adding that, following the monitoring exercise, the EU had waived its non-disclosure policy with regard to forward-spending.\\u00a0 Fuad Albassam, Assistant Director General, <a href=\\\"http://www.ofid.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">OPEC Fund for International Development</a> emphasised OFID\\u2019s commitment to transparency whilst reflecting that this is sometimes difficult to achieve.</p><p>From the floor, Judith Randel, Executive Director at\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://devinit.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Development Initiatives</a> called for IATI\\u2019s \\u201cpublish once, use often\\u201d principle to be applied to other resource flows that support poverty eradication, Monica Asuna from Kenya emphasised the problem of aid not being recorded on budget, while Juanita Olarte Suescun from Colombia urged donors not to forget the commitments made at Accra and Busan \\u2013 partner countries are still waiting to receive the information they were promised then.</p><p>The session was rounded off by Samuel Aggrey from Ghana who reflected the points made above, reminding participants that transparency is a shared endeavour and one that the Global Partnership is well-placed to take forward.</p><p>As the HLM gets underway here in Mexico today, IATI will be setting up its stall in the Marketplace where we will be demonstrating <a href=\\\"http://d-portal.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">d-portal</a>, the country tracker developed by IATI and Development Initiatives.

We are a diverse group, with people representing partner countries, national and multilateral donors, foundations, civil society organisations and private sector organisations. Another of our strengths is that we include tech geeks, data and business analysts, comms specialists and policy people, giving us a full appreciation of the production and use of the data. And we care about what we do and are passionate about the potential to transform our world.</p><p>So, how do we build on this wealth of energy and enthusiasm now that we are all back at our day jobs?</p><p>Here are a few concrete steps, based on the sessions we held on <a href=\\\"https://tag2014.hackpad.com/Improving-the-work-of-the-TAG-fiviZvGpWo0\\\" title=\\\"Hackpad record of the improving the work of the TAG session\\\">improving the work of the TAG</a>:</p><h2>1. Improve our online communities</h2><p>We have a range of online spaces for the TAG, including the <a href=\\\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iati-technical\\\" title=\\\"IATI TAG mailing list\\\">mailing list</a>, <a href=\\\"http://wiki.iatistandard.org/\\\" title=\\\"IATI technical wiki\\\">wiki</a>, <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org\\\" title=\\\"IATI Standard documentation\\\">iatistandard.org</a> and <a href=\\\"http://support.iatistandard.org/\\\" title=\\\"IATI support site\\\">support.iatistandard.org</a>.

Meet up IRL (in real life)</h2><p>Communities thrive when people can connect, both online and in person. We want to hold more physical meetups, whether based locally (city/country), or by topic (all geocoders or people with an interest in budget identifiers), or in parallel with existing events (like the <a href=\\\"http://2014.okfestival.org/\\\" title=\\\"OK Festival Berlin\\\">Open Knowledge Festival in Berlin</a>).

Then share your community events with the worldwide TAG through blog posts or the mailing list.</p><h2>3. Improve our documentation</h2><p>We recognise that the IATI technical documentation can be improved, so that different people (publishers, analysts, end users) can get access to the information they need, and so that whether you are new to IATI or have been working with IATI for years, you can get access to relevant helpful information.</p><p><img alt=\\\"icon_6677\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2686\\\" height=\\\"20\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/icon_6677-e1392208105134.original.png\\\" width=\\\"20\\\"/> <em><strong>How can you help?</strong></em> Volunteer to improve the documentation for one or more key areas \\u2013 use the mailing list to let the IATI technical team know what you are willing to improve.</p><h2>4. Establish working groups</h2><p>One of the ways to improve the TAG is to form collaborative working groups on particular topics or themes. That way we can develop ideas, work up proposals or even just collaborate on making a small improvement. Working groups also spread the workload and mean that we can achieve more.</p><p><img alt=\\\"icon_6677\\\" class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2686\\\" height=\\\"20\\\" src=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/icon_6677-e1392208105134.original.png\\\" width=\\\"20\\\"/> <em><strong>How can you help?</strong></em> Volunteer to form a working group, maybe on one of the actions arising from the TAG.

Donors will also be able to do their jobs better with transparency data \\u2013 informing decisions, making partner collaboration easier, fighting corruption and in being accountable to taxpayers.</p><p>Citizens in both donor and developing countries similarly lack the information they need to hold their governments to account for use of these resources. According to Seth Tekper, Minister of Finance of Ghana, \\u201cdeveloping countries face huge challenges in assessing up-to-date information about development assistance and this adversely affects our ability to effectively plan and manage our economic development.\\u201d</p><p>IATI aims to address these gaps by making information about development spending easier to access, use and understand. \\u201cThe aims and objectives of IATI are in line with the Government of Ghana fiscal policy objectives of strengthening budget processes and financial accounting methods,\\u201d said Minister Tekper. \\u201cIt is in light of this that Ghana endorsed the IATI and has been an active member to date\\u201d.</p><p><strong>Way forward</strong></p><p>IATI\\u2019s ability to adjust to the changing development cooperation architecture will be a key challenge in advancing IATI implementation over the next three years. In addition to increasing the use of IATI data, particularly at the country level, IATI\\u2019s priorities going forward include improving the standard and expanding its membership.</p><p>IATI will need to incorporate information on broader development finance flows, in addition to official development assistance. This will require deeper engagement with a wide range of providers of development cooperation, particularly emerging economies, foundations, and the private sector.</p><p>On behalf of Development Initiatives<i>,</i> Harpinder Collacott said, \\u201cas technical lead for the consortium, our aim is to support more organizations to publish to the IATI standard, to improve the quality of the data that is published, and to promote greater use of IATI data\\u201d.</p><p>IATI will equally work to strengthen partnerships with other initiatives around transparency, and to increase convergence towards a single common open standard. A technical team comprised of IATI and OECD-DAC experts has been working to ensure complementarity with the OECD-DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS), and the Forward Spending Survey (FSS) in the common standard.</p><p>These topics will be discussed during the next IATI Steering Committee on 2-3 October, in the new UN City in Copenhagen.</p><p>Jan Mattsson, UNOPS Executive Director said, \\u201cI am delighted to welcome members of IATI to Copenhagen in October for the first steering committee meeting with the new Secretariat.

The organization has continually proven its commitment to transparency and adhered to its IATI implementation schedule, recently launching open.undp.org and publishing over US$5.8 billion in project data. UNDP has also been a member of the IATI Secretariat since 2011, supporting pilot initiatives in developing countries to test the benefits of IATI. UNDP will lead the new Secretariat and have overall responsibility for coordination, communications, outreach to partner countries and non-traditional donors, and liaison with the Steering Committee.</p><p>UNOPS demonstrated its commitment to IATI by becoming the first UN institution to publish its information as per the standard in October 2011. It has since supported other UN agencies in their efforts to do so, as well as taking forward the wider transparency agenda, for example, in the area of UN procurement. UNOPS will provide financial management and administrative services, including procurement, collection of membership fees and additional voluntary contributions, disbursement of resources to partners and contract management. UNOPS will also ensure the smooth running of all logistical aspects of the IATI Secretariat, Steering Committee and TAG meetings.</p><p>Ghana was one of the first partner countries to endorse IATI and has been a vocal member of the IATI Steering Committee and the Partner Country Caucus, frequently representing the views of partner countries to the wider group. Ghana\\u2019s broader commitment to transparency is clear in the wording of its constitution, its accession to the Africa Peer Review Mechanism and its membership of the Open Government Partnership. Ghana is well placed to galvanise partner countries to engage in the IATI process given its pioneering role in transparent government and its credentials as the host of the Accra High Level Forum-3 as well as the IATI consultative workshop for the West and Central Africa Regions. Ghana will chair IATI\\u2019s partner country caucus, lead IATI\\u2019s political engagement and support outreach with partner countries, and ensure that the interests of partner countries are fully represented in the management of the initiative.</p><p>Sweden,a founder member of IATI, was one of the first donors to publish to the standard, and was seconded to the IATI Secretariat in the run up to Busan to enhance capacity for political engagement and ensure coordination with the Building Block on Transparency (which it co-chaired with the World Bank). Sweden has also demonstrated its commitment to transparency through the launch of national initiatives such as its aid transparency guarantee and its web-based platform, OpenAid.se, and through its engagement with other global initiatives including the Open Government Partnership, the Open Aid Partnership and the Grand Challenge Making Voices Count. Sweden will lead IATI\\u201ds political engagement and outreach to donors, and ensure liaison between the IATI Secretariat and other relevant fora such as the Open Government Partnership, the Open Aid Partnership, the OECD-DAC (WP-STAT), and the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation in the context of the common standard.</p><p>Development Initiatives (DI) has been a member of the IATI Secretariat and Steering Committee from the outset, responsible for drafting the initial scoping paper on IATI, helping to shape the IATI standard, with an emphasis on ensuring that the standard meets the needs of stakeholders in partner countries, and managing the development and launch of the IATI Registry. To date, DI has provided technical support to 25 IATI signatories in publishing their aid information to the IATI Registry. It was the first NGO to publish to IATI in July 2011 and has since worked with BOND to support 60 UK NGOs plus 12 other non-signatories to publish to IATI. DI will provide technical leadership and support for implementation, and for maintaining and developing the IATI standard. It will continue to provide support to communications and outreach activities of other consortium members.</p><p>Media Contact:\\u00a0<a href=\\\"mailto:media@iatistandard.org\\\">media@iatistandard.org</a></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

A multi-stakeholder consortium has been chosen to host the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), giving new impetus to the drive to increase the transparency and effectiveness of development spending.</p><p>The consortium \\u2013 led by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and including the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), the Governments of Ghana and Sweden, and a UK-based NGO Development Initiatives \\u2013 was selected by IATI\\u2019s Steering Committee in Paris on March 13 following a competitive process. \\u00a0Beginning in mid-2013 for a three year period, the consortium will take over the role carried out since 2009 by the UK\\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID).</p><p>Developing countries today face huge challenges in accessing up-to-date information about aid, and in planning and managing these resources effectively. Citizens in developing and donor countries similarly lack the information they need to hold their governments to account for use of these resources.</p><p>IATI aims to address these gaps by making information about aid spending easier to access, use and understand.</p><p>Launched in 2008, IATI provides a common data format for donors willing to release information about current and future aid spending in a timely, comparable and reliable way. Financial flows, budgets, results, location, timelines and project documents are published into an online repository accessible to all users interested in tracking where, when and how aid is spent.</p><p>More than 120 UN agencies, multilateral banks, bilateral donors and NGOs covering 76 per cent of official development assistance input their information to IATI, and more than 20 partner countries have endorsed the initiative.</p><p>Each member of the consortium brings a unique set of strengths and all have demonstrated their strong commitment to transparency and the goals of IATI. The consortium approach will ensure that the initiative remains inclusive and dynamic, reflecting the changing development environment of today\\u2019s world.</p><p>UNDP will lead the consortium, coordinate the work of the secretariat and use its global network to promote and expand IATI\\u2019s effectiveness. UNOPS will provide financial and administrative services. Development Initiatives will support IATI\\u2019s Technical Advisory Group and provide technical support to IATI publishers. Ghana will ensure that partner countries are engaged and represented. Sweden will reach out to and engage donor countries.</p><p>IATI\\u2019s ability to adjust to the changing aid architecture will be a key challenge in advancing IATI implementation over the next three years. IATI will need to incorporate information on broader development cooperation initiatives, in addition to official development assistance. This will require deeper engagement with a wide range of providers of development cooperation, particularly emerging economies, foundations, and the private sector.</p><p>IATI will work to ensure complementarity with the OECD-DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS), the Forward Spending Survey (FSS) in the common standard and prioritize progressive convergence towards a single common open standard, with all Busan endorsers completing common standard implementation schedules outlining their plans to fully implement this standard by the end of 2015.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Consortium members</span></p><p>UNDP with its presence in 177 countries brings unparalleled outreach opportunity with all stakeholders and across the UN system. Ensuring improved aid effectiveness is fundamental to UNDP\\u2019s vision and forms the basis for its work globally. The organisation has continually proven its commitment to transparency and adhered to its IATI implementation schedule, recently launching open.undp.org and publishing over $5.8 billion in project data. UNDP provides Secretariat support to ensure the effective functioning of the Global Partnership. Through this relationship and the Development Cooperation Forum (DCF), UNDP has the opportunity to coordinate efforts between IATI and other initiatives around aid transparency to implement the Global Common Standard on Transparency agreed in Busan.. Playing a key role in the consultations leading to the establishment of the post-2015 agenda, UNDP also sees the opportunity to raise the profile of IATI within that forum. Specifically, UNDP will ensure the consortium is delivering its objectives, coordinate and oversee the administration and financial management of the consortium, lead its outreach and information functions, and provide overall substantive support to IATI Secretariat, TAG and Steering Committee meetings, fundraising efforts, and to the reform of IATI structures.</p><p>UNOPS demonstrated its commitment to IATI by becoming the first UN agency to publish to the standard in October 2011. It has since supported other UN agencies in their efforts to do so, as well as taking forward the wider transparency agenda, for example in the area of UN procurement. UNOPS brings its experience as the legal host to other multi-stakeholder initiatives as well as providing support to other international secretariats, both inside and outside the UN system. UNOPS has strong skills in efficient and cost-effective project management and in creative fundraising. UNOPS will provide financial management and administrative services within the consortium \\u2013 including HR, procurement, collecting contributions, disbursing resources to partners and contract management, and ensure the smooth running of all logistical aspects of IATI Secretariat and Steering Committee meetings and other activities.</p><p>Ghana was one of the first partner countries to endorse IATI and has been a vocal member of the IATI Steering Committee and the Partner Country Caucus, frequently representing the views of partner countries to the wider group. Ghana\\u2019s broader commitment to transparency is clear in the wording of its constitution, its accession to the Africa Peer Review Mechanism and its membership of the Open Government Partnership. Ghana is well placed to galvanise partner countries to engage in the IATI process given its pioneering role in transparent government and its credentials as the host of the Accra HLF-3 as well as the IATI consultative workshop for the West and Central Africa Regions. Ghana will co-lead the consortium\\u2019s engagement and outreach with partner countries alongside UNDP. It will also contribute political leadership to the reform of IATI structures and ensure that the interests of partner countries are fully represented in the management of the initiative.</p><p>Sweden is a founder member of IATI, was one of the first donors to publish to the standard, and was seconded to the IATI Secretariat in the run up to Busan to enhance capacity for political engagement and ensure coordination with the Building Block on Transparency (which it co-chaired with the World Bank). Sweden has also demonstrated its commitment to transparency through the launch of national initiatives such as its aid transparency guarantee and its web-based platform, OpenAid.se, and through its engagement with other global initiatives including the Open Government Partnership, the Open Aid Partnership and the Grand Challenge Making Voices Count. As an acknowledged world leader on transparency, Sweden is well-placed to lead the consortium in its political engagement and outreach to other donors, and to ensure liaison between IATI and other processes such as the Open Government Partnership, the Open Aid Partnership, the OECD-DAC (WP-STAT), the Global Partnership and the Common Standard. It will also provide political leadership to the reform of IATI structures.</p><p>Development Initiatives has been a member of the IATI Secretariat and Steering Committee from the outset, responsible for drafting the initial scoping paper on IATI, helping to shape the IATI standard, with an emphasis on ensuring that the standard meets the needs of stakeholders in partner countries, and managing the development and launch of the IATI Registry. To date, DI has provided technical support to 35 IATI signatories in publishing their aid information to the IATI Registry, was the first CSO to publish to IATI in July 2011 and has since worked with BOND to support 73 UK CSOs plus 12 other non-signatories to publish to IATI. DI\\u2019s primary role within the consortium will be the continued provision of technical leadership and support, including the technical support necessary for maintaining the IATI standard, and managing support for implementation. DI will also continue to play a role in outreach, with a specific remit to engage with non-traditional donors (NGOs, foundations and the private sector) whilst supporting other consortium members who lead on other aspects of outreach and engagement.</p><p>\\u2014-</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

New members are:\\u00a0 Belgium, Canada (CIDA), CDC, International Labour Organisation (ILO), Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), UN-HABITAT, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UN Women, US Government and World Food Programme (WFP).</p><p><b>22 partner countries</b> have endorsed IATI: Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia, Lebanon, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Moldova, Montenegro, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Syria, Tanzania, and Vietnam.</p><p><strong>Using IATI data \\u2013 compliant data at country level</strong></p><p>Recently, IATI, with Development Gateway and Development Initiatives, has successfully piloted automated data exchange between donors\\u2019 IATI data feeds and the national aid management system in DRC, the Plateforme de Gestion de l\\u2019Aide et des Investissements (PGAI). \\u00a0PGAI is now using live IATI data from DFID, The Global Fund and GAVI, with plans to roll this out to other donors including Canada, EC, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and UNDP in the coming months.\\u00a0 Similar work in aligning IATI data with national aid information management systems and country budgets is planned in Rwanda and Nepal, while IATI is exploring the scope for integrating data from NGOs and South-South Cooperation providers in aid management systems in Colombia.</p><p>As well as work with government partners, the aidinfo programme is working with civil society partners in Nepal, Kenya and Uganda to improve access and support use of the data being published.</p><p><strong>IATI access and use of data </strong></p><p>It is important to note that it is still very early days for IATI implementation, and as we have seen in other open data initiatives, it takes a little time for a market of tools to emerge. However we are starting to see the ecosystem of use of the data emerge. A number of donors (Netherlands, UK, UN Habitat, UNOPS) have built website applications to visualise their own data, and we are starting to see early versions of some interesting tools that bring all the IATI data together in one place such as AidView.net and <a href=\\\"http://beta.openaidsearch.org/\\\">OpenAid</a>. These and other tools are showcased by <a href=\\\"http://aidinfolabs.org/\\\">aidinfolabs.org</a>, which promotes new initiatives and provides access to the technical code so it can be reused. It currently has over 20 packages of code.</p><p>However, there is much to do in order to improve the accessibility of data, which highlights several development needs for IATI in 2013. The most significant is development of the <a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/\\\">IATI Registry</a> and Data Store to enable easier access to the data. Work is being done in partnership with the <a href=\\\"http://okfn.org/\\\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> to provide download of a bespoke extract of data (e.g. all health projects in Ghana) in a format selected by the user.</p><p><strong>Working toward a common standard</strong></p><p>The IATI Secretariat convened a group to define the <a href=\\\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/aid-architecture/acommonstandard.htm\\\">common standard</a> together with representatives of IATI\\u2019s multi-stakeholder Steering Committee with representatives of the OECD DAC\\u2019s Working Party on Statistics and the leaders of the Busan Building Block on Transparency. Detailed negotiations led to an agreement that was endorsed by the final meeting of the Working Party on Aid Effectiveness (WP-EFF) in June 2012.</p><p>This confirmed that the common standard should work to combine three complementary systems, the DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and Forward Spending Survey (FSS) and IATI. The group has since agreed the common template for an implementation schedule for the common standard.</p><p><strong>What was your stand out IATI moment for 2012?</strong></p><p><strong>Share your stories by emailing me at <a href=\\\"mailto:kim.borrowdale@devinit.org\\\">kim.borrowdale@devinit.org</a> or share them with the community on Twitter by using #IATI.</strong></p><p>\\u00a0</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

We\\u2019ve spent many years talking about open data, but open development is so much more than that. During the discussion at this session it was clear that we needed a \\u201cparticipatory process\\u201d, \\u201cone that is more horizontal than top down\\u201d, and that empowers citizens to claim their role in deciding and managing development processes.</p><p>Openness doesn\\u2019t just mean making things publicly available, but is about involving all actors in the process. But, what does this mean in practice?</p><p>Philip Thigo from The Social Development Network (Kenya) made an interesting point about the language used in the development community.\\u00a0 In open development, words and phrases like \\u2018the developing world\\u2019 etc. would not be used as citizens would be part of the process rather than recipients. If open is an \\u2018attitude\\u2019, how does our tone of voice need to change? This needs to be more than just a concept. We need to take concrete steps to get to open development.\\u00a0 John Adams from DfID (Department for International Development) used IATI as an example of something that started as a political commitment to transparency, and, with firm actions, has developed into the IATI Standard and clear steps for implementation. What are the steps we need to take to move open development from a concept into a working infrastructure?</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Trying to explain Open Development? Open for Change launched a great video at OKfest to help you do just that \\u2013 <a href=\\\"http://openforchange.info/\\\">Watch it here</a></p><ol>\\n<li><strong>\\u201c</strong><strong>Knowing is not enough. We must apply. Willing is not enough. We must do.\\u201d</strong> \\u2013 Bruce Lee via <a href=\\\"http://www.aidinfo.org/about-us/team/simon-parrish\\\">Simon Parrish</a> from aidinfo</li>\\n</ol><p>Putting aside the entertainment value of seeing Bruce Lee on an IATI presentation slide, this quote sums up the point \\u00a0a number of speakers were making in relation to good intentions and developing robust solutions over time versus getting on with it and learning and adapting as we go.</p><p>We have seen this in the IATI community. Yes, we have structures in place to change our approach more formally when needed, but this should not slow the pace of those leading the way in opening up their development data. What we have learned is that it doesn\\u2019t have to be perfect, get it out there to the community so it can be used, refined, and developed.</p><p>Michael Edson made some interesting points on this subject, in his keynote speech <a href=\\\"http://www.slideshare.net/edsonm/michael-edson-lego-beowulf-and-the-web-of-hands-and-hearts-for-the-danish-national-museum-awards\\\">\\u2018Lego, Beowulf and the Web of Hands and Hearts\\u2019</a>, as part of the Open Cultural Heritage topic stream,. As Director of of Web and New Media Strategy at the Smithsonian Institution, he has seen museum websites go from the authoritative voice to one of many on the web, often far down the list behind YouTube, Wikipedia and community discussion forums.\\u00a0 If we continue with the mind-set that we need to plan and perfect over months and months before publishing, we will get left behind \\u2013 \\u201cStop thinking about it and do it \\u2013 Don\\u2019t talk about what you want to do, just do it. Mock it up and talk very fast\\u201d.</p><p><strong>WARNING:</strong> You may become addicted to Googling lego re-enactments of historical events after watching Michael\\u2019s keynote speech.</p><ol>\\n<li><strong>\\u201cGet to the exciting stuff. I\\u2019m so bored by the basics, there is so much more we can do!\\u201d</strong> \\u2013 IATI Technical Advisory Group member (possibly overheard at the pub)</li>\\n</ol><p>Now I\\u2019m pretty sure this was a reference to IATI (International Aid Transparency Initiative) and the elements currently required (link). I\\u2019m not sure where I heard the comment but I was struck by this point. Yes! Why are we limiting ourselves to some kind of common standard that is a mere minimum?! We should do more; push the limits of the data we seek out on behalf of partner countries.</p><p>This was even clearer after attending several IATI workshops. The development community is an ambitious one, constantly asking each other what this means at grass roots level. However, what is also clear from these sessions is that when it comes to understanding what it means to be transparent, all actors in the development space are at different places on the transparency spectrum \\u2013 and it involves so much more than just picking and choosing the data to make available. There are policy and process conversations to be had including short, medium and long term technology and resource plans to be made.</p><p>We currently have <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/en/about/-who-uses-iati/ or www.iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/who-runs-iati/ \\\">82 IATI publishers</a> and plan to report on their compliance to the IATI Standard and future implementation plans early in 2013. While many have made outstanding progress since committing to IATI, I think it would be fair to say that not one of the publishers has a perfect scorecard just yet. As each organisation finds it way in this increasingly transparent world, we should remind ourselves that complying with standards like IATI is not where effort ends. It is just laying solid (accessible and comparable) foundations for being able to \\u201cget to the exciting stuff\\u201d.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Delegates who attended the IATI workshop for NGOs found it useful when Joni Hillman from <a href=\\\"http://www.bond.org.uk/\\\">BOND</a> and Rolf Kleef from <a href=\\\"https://partos.nl/\\\">PARTOS</a> talked them through the IATI five point plan for compliance. This approach may be useful for your organisation \\u2013 find a copy <a href=\\\"http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/20648592-the-five-steps-to-becoming-iati-compliant\\\">here</a></p><ol>\\n<li><strong>\\u201cWhat about my mother in a small village, with no phone, no internet and no English?\\u201d</strong> \\u2013 came up in just about every session but I think I heard John Ndungu from iLabAfrica say it first</li>\\n</ol><p>When you have a lot of people who are passionate about data, technology and development, it is easy to get caught up in finding the best technical solution and drill down to the detailed data requirements needed for that solution.</p><p>But, at the Africa Labs session in particular, it was evident that whatever the question that needs answering, the solution will need to be a combination of communication channels, from cutting edge to traditional, depending on the end user. Yes, we need ways to show data that is accessible to those who rely heavily on the internet. These are often important internal engagement tools for organisations and governments needing to progress the commitment to transparency, as well as influencing and decision tools for those working directly on projects and programmes in country. But, what about John\\u2019s mother in the village? How will we know what information she needs and what format will be most palpable for her?</p><p>There were some great reminders at OKfest about the importance of including traditional channels of communication such as community radio and print media. There was also recognition of increased mobile and smartphone use but some limited knowledge of the features of such \\u2013 perhaps text messaging or voicemail should be considered as well as mobile responsive design of web tools?</p><p>And, once you determine the right channels to give access to information, what is relevant to each recipient? While we can \\u2018type\\u2019 communities according to the communication channels most relevant to them, we cannot assume that within this grouping that each individual is seeking out the same information for the same reasons.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Use videos to help stakeholders in your organisation understand the different perspectives and challenges in partner countries. During the Africa Lab, our friends from El Salvador showed a <a href=\\\"http://ht.ly/dWfrz\\\">video</a> that was very effective in showing how even people with similar social circumstances are often coming from completely different perspectives in terms of the information they want to access.</p><ol>\\n<li><strong>\\u201cWho knew they are trying to do the same stuff as us in the museum world?\\u201d</strong> \\u2013 Me, as I sat in on one of the Cultural Heritage topic stream lectures</li>\\n</ol><p>In one of the sessions in the Open Cultural Heritage topic stream, Neelie Kroes, Vice President of the European Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda gave a virtual address, highlighting the European Commission\\u2019s commitment to policies, projects and funding to support open data and open access, including for public sector information, cultural data, science and research.</p><p>What was interesting to me is that we in the development community have a similar agenda to those in other sectors \\u2013 from museums and culture to science and universities. We are looking to open up access to information in order to inform future decisions and direction. What have we learned with open data and work on IATI that could help other sectors in taking practical steps to transparency? And, most importantly for us, what are lessons have those learned in other sectors that could help progress the open development agenda?</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Think about your friends in different sectors. Have they made progress in opening up their knowledge where you haven\\u2019t? Or perhaps they can give you a different perspective on how to communicate.

We\\u2019re really pleased to be taking this important step in our journey to become a more open and transparent organisation.</p><p>We\\u2019ve also launched the <a href=\\\"http://open.unhabitat.org/\\\">Open UN-Habitat</a> website which will be the focal point for our open data and transparency work over the coming months and years. The site launches with six projects, but over the next few weeks we will be adding more.</p><p>The technology behind the site is all open source. We worked with the Dutch nonprofit Akvo and their <a href=\\\"http://oipa.openaidsearch.org/api/v2/docs/\\\">OIPA tool</a> to index the IATI data. OIPA is a search tool built in Django which enables IATI compliant datasets to be easily parsed and was developed by <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/siemvaessen\\\">Siem Vaessen</a>. The front end was built by Kenyan web agency <a href=\\\"http://www.verviant.com/\\\">Verviant</a> in WordPress. All the technology we used is available under a Creative Commons license <a href=\\\"https://github.com/openaid-IATI/OPEN-UN-HABITAT\\\">on Github</a>.</p><p>During phase one of the transparency initiative we will add projects approved since 1 January 2012. The aim is then to add all projects that we are currently involved in delivering. The process of backdating will take some time but we hope that it will be completed during 2013.</p><p>We see this as a work in progress and the site is currently in \\u2018beta\\u2019. Our starting point is to publish as much data as we can, but for an organisation the size of UN-Habitat this will take time. The first big priorities will be to publish the data that we already have, and automate the process of IATI reporting. Once that is in place, we will focus on improving data quality and improving reporting processes. We would also like to make the data more useful by doing sub-national geocoding, providing transaction level information on fund commitments and disbursements and publishing monitoring and evaluation reports.</p><p>If you have any comments or thoughts, we would love <a href=\\\"http://open.unhabitat.org/contact/\\\">to hear them</a>.</p><p><span style=\\\"color: #808080;\\\">Alternatively contact me directly on\\u00a0<span style=\\\"color: #3366ff;\\\">pontus.westerberg@unhabitat.org</span></span></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

To this end, in addition to asking donors states to adopt the IATI standard, Commonwealth member parter countries have called on donors to:</p><blockquote><p>fast-track the implementation of key components needed to deliver on aid effectiveness commitments including publishing information on results, conditions, activity-level budgets and future flows: to explore how best to include non-ODA flows in IATI, including the rapid integration of climate finance into IATI; and to ensure that contractors employed by donors use IATI.</p></blockquote><p>The Commonwealth Secretary General, Kamalesh Sharma, emphasised the large role that Commonwealth countries play in global aid flows, stating:</p><blockquote><p>The Commonwealth currently occupies a central and influential position in global aid flows with a large number of members comprising aid recipients and a growing number as aid donors. Commonwealth members of the Development Action Committee (DAC) of the OECD provide annual aid exceeding $23 billion while aid received by Commonwealth developing countries aggregates some $28 billion.\\u00a0 Our members account for 18 per cent of global ODA disbursements and 22 per cent of receipts from DAC donors.</p></blockquote><p>We really welcome this positive development. We look forward to hearing more from member states on their progress with signing, endorsing and implementing IATI; keep an eye out here for any new developments.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

This paper provides a tool for assessing the costs and benefits of increased aid transparency, with particular reference to the potential costs and benefits of implementing the emerging proposals of the International Aid Transparency Initiative.It attempts to quantify the administrative cost to each donor of implementing IATI, the potential efficiency savings for both donors and recipient countries, and the resulting gains in aid effectiveness.</p><p>The paper concludes that while there will be variations between donors, the efficiency savings of implementing IATI are likely to pay for the transitional cost within a year or two. While the effectiveness gains are more uncertain, the paper concludes that even on the most conservative estimates, the benefits of greater aid transparency vastly outweigh the estimated costs. The Steering Committee endorsed the proposed framework at its April meeting and confirmed that no further work is required by the Secretariat, since the paper provides sufficient information and analytical framework for individual donors to conduct their own cost-benefit appraisals should they wish to do so.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Both chapters have specific provisions in relation to aid transparency:</p><ul>\\n<li>Donors agree to provide information on their assistance before the end of the year (i.e. 2009) and the Government undertakes to include it in the 2010 budget (para. 6);</li>\\n<li>Donors and the Government agree to further use the aid information management system put in place by the Ministry of Plan called Platform for the Management of Aid and Investments (PGAI \\u2013 French acronym) and to strengthen the capacities of the local management team (para. 13).</li>\\n</ul><p>Since then, the Ministry of Plan has made significant progress in the collection of information from donors in an environment where aid represents an important share of GNI (according to the OECD the net ODA/GNI ratio was 15.6% in 2008[1]) and for the most part is provided off budget. While a major public financial reform is underway, which will improve the budget-execution system and strengthen the overall budget culture, the Ministry of Plan is in discussions with development partners on a follow-up agreement to the Kinshasa Agenda, i.e. <strong>a Code of Conduct</strong>, that will define the scope of information to be provided to the PGAI by donors, NGOs and line ministries; the regularity of the updates and the way the information will be used. The objectives are to set the expectations straight, further streamline the reporting/validation processes, but also to ensure that the quality of information in the system effectively supports national planning and budgeting.\\u00a0 In this regard, the Ministry of Budget is keen on using the PGAI for the budget process and needs information on actual and planned disbursements, which is submitted in line with the national budget cycle. For the majority of development partners, meeting this requirement is feasible and a number of them are already doing so. According to Yvon Mombong, Coordinator of the PGAI <em>\\u201cdonors are willing to provide information, but are often not available when it comes to entering data into the system or updating it\\u201d.</em> Staff turnover, time constraints and other priorities take over. The hope is that the future Code of Conduct will become a viable tool, underpinning the Kinshasa Agenda and the public financial reform efforts in the DRC.</p><hr size=\\\"1\\\"/><p><a href=\\\"#_ftnref1\\\">[1]</a> Source: <a href=\\\"http://www.google.com\\\">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/31/1901167.gif</a>.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Unfortunately no partner countries had commented by the deadline.</p><p>The consultation remains open at <a href=\\\"http://www.iaticonsultation.org/\\\">www.iaticonsultation.org</a> for those who still wish to comment. Online consultation enables us to process feedback as efficiently as possible and allows all participants to view comments made by others. The proposals on the scope of IATI are accompanied by specific proposals from the TAG on common definitions and data format that were discussed by the TAG at its meeting on 22 and 23 March (see <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/documents/tag-meeting-record-22-and-23-march-2010-final.doc\\\">record</a> of that meeting). They include existing codes lists (via hyperlinks on the site) that we propose should form the core of the IATI standard taxonomy, on which we can subsequently build.</p><p>The comments welcomed the greater level of precision about the proposals and, with a couple of exceptions, that they build on existing reporting standards. But as the deadline of reporting on phase\\u00a01 by the end of 2010 approaches, donors are cautioning about changes they will need to make to their systems and the difficulty of reporting monthly and in more detail. Some question the inclusion of a few data elements or seek more information and/or to postpone some items to a later phase. All continue to have problems with providing budgets and planned disbursements 3 to 5 years ahead.\\u00a0 CSOs wish to see the momentum maintained, faster progress on items such as conditionality, and information on the outcome of procurement.</p><p>The TAG Secretariat is now reviewing the comments and will invite comment between 4<sup> </sup>June and 11\\u00a0June on any major issues (with a one week lag for\\u00a0French and Spanish versions). We will circulate a revised version of the proposals, with recommendations where choices need to be made, on 23 June prior to a meeting of the all signatories, Steering Committee\\u00a0members and endorsers of IATI in Paris on <strong>7 July, to agree final, detailed proposals for data.</strong></p><p>Implementation of IATI will be phased, increasingly helping to meet commitments made in the Accra Agenda for Action. The consultation document outlines the proposed phasing of publication for each category of information. We have sent a donor assessment questionnaire to signatories and observers seeking information about any flexibility they require within the overall phasing for staged implementation. The content and timing of the phases is as follows:</p><p>Phase one \\u2013 end of 2010</p><p>This will lay the foundations for IATI. It focuses on more timely publication of data that are already captured by donor systems plus interim advice on linking documents that are already in the public domain to IATI. Phase one will also provide some high-level information on future aid flows, in total and for contributions to major international institutions.</p><p>Phase two \\u2013 September 2011 \\u2013 prior to the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness.</p><p>This proposes to expand the range of existing information by publishing data that are routinely collected by donors\\u2019 internal systems, such as project contacts, beneficiaries and budgets, as well as information on conditions and future aid flows at country-budget level. It will link the published data to the economic, sectoral, functional and administrative classifications used by recipient country budgets.</p><p>Phase three \\u2013 end of 2012</p><p>This proposes to further expand the range of data and documents published to include some categories of information that are not routinely collected by donor systems and will therefore require more substantial amendments to existing systems, e.g. detailed geographic information, output and outcome indicators and results indicators.</p><p>During the second half of 2010, we will do further work on part four of the IATI standard\\u2014the code of conduct\\u2014and on publication of documents and the remaining data items. We will present proposals for consultation in October and November.</p><p>We encourage everyone to comment. This is your chance to shape IATI!</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

The paper,<a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/documents/Implementing-IATI-Jan-2010-v2.pdf\\\"> Implementing IATI: Practical Proposals</a> argues that rather than just improving existing databases, IATI should extend the range of aid information that is made available, including documents as well as data, and make it quick and easy for users to find.<span id=\\\"more-559\\\"></span></p><p>Secretariat member Carolyn Culey explains how the system would work:</p><blockquote><p>\\u201cDonors would use their existing internal systems for collecting aid information.\\u00a0 But they would include additional information needed by other stakeholders and publish the information more rapidly, and in a common electronic format. They would then register the location of their information in an IATI Registry \\u2013 a kind of online catalogue that would enable users to locate it.\\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The paper notes that many different users want access to aid information for many different purposes, and no single database can satisfactorily meet all of those diverse needs.  It says that donors are currently engaged in duplicate reporting, for example providing information to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) databases and to many individual country-based Aid Information Management Systems (AIMS), as well as responding to ad hoc requests for aid information.</p><p>\\u201cThe IATI approach can be summarised as \\u2018publish once, use often\\u2019\\u201d says Calolyn Culey. \\u201cIt will reduce duplicate reporting by allowing donors to assemble their aid information once, in a way that would meet existing internal and external reporting requirements, at the same time as responding to the demand for additional information.\\u201d</p><p>The proposals are designed to minimise the additional burden and maximum benefits of aid transparency by ensuring that information, once collected, is universally accessible.</p><p>Click here to view the  a copy of the full study  <a href=\\\"https://www.iatistandard.org/media/documents/Implementing-IATI-Jan-2010-v2.pdf\\\">Implementing IATI: Practical Proposals.</a></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Integration and use of IATI data in country aid information management systems (AIMS) and processes is therefore a significant opportunity and priority, as reflected in <a href=\\\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/iati-data-use-strategy-2017-19\\\">IATI\\u2019s data use strategy</a> and <a href=\\\"http://devinit.org/post/aid-data-needs-use-cases-nepal/\\\">DI\\u2019s own research</a>.</p><p>In this context, Development Initiatives was pleased to partner with <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/\\\">Development Gateway</a> to pilot an effort to support technical capacity and practical ability to use IATI data within country systems in Senegal and Madagascar.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Generously supported by UNICEF and focused around import of their data during the pilot phase, this involved the placement, training and accompaniment of Aid Management Fellows in the foreign aid units of both governments. Development Gateway, with their long-standing experience in national aid management systems, were leading the overall effort, while DI contributed its technical expertise in IATI.</p><p><b>Read the </b><a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/fullreport\\\"><b>full report</b></a><b> about the experience and lessons learned.</b></p><p>A <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/summary\\\">summary report</a> was also developed, which includes a series of questions and answers that development partners and government partners might ask when considering using IATI data in local AIMS.</p><p>Two country-specific reports for <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/madagascar\\\">Madagascar</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/senegal\\\">Senegal</a> on strengthening the capacity to use IATI in AIMS were also produced. Please also have a look at <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/blog/did-we-make-publish-once-dream-reality\\\">Development Gateway\\u2019s blog and reflections</a> on how we have progressed in making the \\u2018publish once, use often\\u2019 dream a reality.</p><p>As detailed in the full report, the pilot delivered important results and learnings. For example, use of IATI data in Senegal\\u2019s Aid Management Platform resulted in adding data on more than US$200m in donor commitments and almost the same amount in disbursements to the data previously available to the government.</p><p>In Madagascar, there was significantly more project data in the IATI file than in the country\\u2019s Aid Management Platform. While of course a number of technical challenges had to be overcome in the data import in Madagascar and Senegal, both countries have started taking important steps to help donor organisations roll out IATI-based reporting.</p><p>As part of the IATI Secretariat, Development Initiatives leads on the management and technical implementation of the IATI Standard. In the pilots, Development Initiatives together with Development Gateway developed an IATI-AIMS Training Guide (available in <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/TrainingGuideEN\\\">English</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/TrainingGuideFR\\\">French</a>) that was used to train the two IATI fellows on how to understand, review and prepare IATI data to be used by the government.</p><p>So, how did the training go?</p><p>There are many reflections and lessons learnt from the training phase that we can mention here, but we have decided to outline two in particular:</p><ul><li><b>Language:</b> You may immediately think there is a language barrier, in terms of the different languages spoken by the trainers (English) and the Aid Management Fellows (French) as well as all most guidance on the IATI website being in English. While this is indeed a challenge for some IATI users, for this particular training it was actually not a problem as the fellows were speaking a bit of English and were working very well together. What was challenging, however, was speaking the same \\u2018IATI language\\u2019. There is such a diverse interpretation of what is meant by transactions, such as \\u2018disbursement\\u2019 or \\u2018commitment\\u2019 by the different users of the data (e.g. UNICEF headquarters, UNICEF country office and government staff). Before using and interpreting the data, it was really important to align the definitions so that there is common understanding and we are able to speak the same \\u2018IATI language\\u2019. We need to create a much simpler narrative that can be understood by all partners, and in all languages, and this pilot contributed to making the first step of the definition mapping.</li><li><b>Importance of partnership, feedback loops and sustaining IATI knowledge:</b> It is not easy to be trained in IATI in a week. This project required joint efforts from many partners collaborating to make it work: Development Gateway, Development Initiatives, the two Aid Management fellows, UNICEF country office staff, UNICEF headquarters staff, and local government staff in Senegal and Madagascar. Face-to-face training with the fellows in Dakar really helped, as well as their commitment and eagerness to learn. The partnerships were already built so there was no issue of trust. Everyone recognised the amount of effort invested in this project and worked really hard to make it work. So, how do we make sure that IATI knowledge is sustained in both Senegal and Madagascar and scaled up in other countries? This project showed that to do so we need to ensure that there is an improved feedback mechanism between IATI publishers (UNICEF headquarters and country office) and IATI users (government), that there is a localised support structure, that knowledge is shared widely and maintained within each organisation.Training people locally who would then be able to share and spread the knowledge more widely (as done by the fellows) is needed to sustain the IATI knowledge and improve the use of IATI data in government.</li></ul><p>Overall, the project demonstrated a practical approach to increasing the use of IATI data in country AIMS. Experience is building with comparable and different experience across other contexts, too, for example in <a href=\\\"https://catalpa.io/project_feature_mohinga/\\\">Myanmar</a> and <a href=\\\"http://bd-iati.github.io/files/Using%20IATI%20data%20to%20enhance%20Bangladesh&#x27;s%20AIMS%20-%20Final%20report.pdf\\\">Bangladesh</a>.</p><p>Going forward, we are keen to keep learning from these and to collaborate with national and international partners to realise the value of IATI data for decision-making in development efforts.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

How is the organisation involved in IATI?</b></p><p>We\\u2019re a UK-based organisation working in the field of transparency and open data. We\\u2019re a technical partner in a number of initiatives such as Open Contracting, 360Giving and <a href=\\\"https://openownership.org/\\\">Open Ownership</a>, where we work on a mix of research and development, technical infrastructure and support for data creators and users.</p><p>Many of our members have been involved in IATI - some since the very early days! We now work with a wide range of organisations to help them plan, prepare, publish and use data in the IATI format. We\\u2019ve also helped organisations to communicate what they need from the Standard to the IATI Technical Advisory Group (TAG) which in turn advises other governing bodies of IATI on technical matters.</p><p><b>2. Why did you decide to join IATI? Why is transparency important?</b></p><p>It was quite obvious, and about time!</p><p>Our members have worked on IATI as experts in the Standard, providing knowledge and insight to users and publishers. Our decision to join is about reminding our members and the wider community that we are all users and stakeholders of the Standard - even a small workers\\u2019 cooperative which doesn\\u2019t fit the mold of a development or humanitarian organisation!</p><p><b>3. How did you first get involved in IATI?</b></p><p>Just after the first draft IATI files were published by DFID in 2011, one of our team attended a hack day hosted at the Guardian and worked on an early exploration and visualization interface to show the potential of this new data source. As a group that was becoming more interested in the potential of open data, we came at IATI as community technologists interested in open data for social impact. Our team was joined by other developers who had previously worked as part of the IATI technical team, contributing code to validators, dashboards and documentation for IATI. We formed Open Data Services Cooperative (GB-COH-09506232) in 2015 to further our work on data like IATI, and support collaboration and connections across different open data standards.</p><p><b>4. IATI is celebrating its 10th birthday this year. What progress have you seen since you first worked on IATI?</b></p><p>It&#x27;s been great to see the growth in data availability - and rising data quality. There are also many more ways that data is now being used, even if this is not always visible to publishers. The way donors are starting to integrate data use in their reporting is also encouraging, and projects like <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/news/iatis-role-in-agricultural-funding-data/\\\">Open Ag Funding</a> have been interesting to explore the potential of IATI for particular sectors - although there is still much to do here to make projects like this sustainable.</p><p>In this anniversary year, it&#x27;s worth noting how much IATI has influenced the wider open data and transparency field. Many of the other projects we work on regularly reference IATI, drawing on approaches pioneered in this community, and generating learning of their own that could feed back into IATI development.</p><p><b>5. What changes would you want to see over the next 10 years?</b></p><p>There is a famous quote (though attributed to a few different people) to the effect \\u201cIf I had more time, I would have written you a shorter letter.\\u201d Taking something as complex as International Aid, and making information on it accessible to many different people, for many different uses, is an ambitious project, and it takes an investment of time and energy to move through complexity, and achieve something that is simple, clear and powerful.</p><p>As a collective, with different backgrounds and views across our team, we\\u2019ve got various ideas of the most important areas for change. A stronger focus on usefulness and usability of the data is one area where we would love to see even more progress - at the same time as continued investment in the core infrastructure of IATI, and bold choices explored about the evolution of the technical approach that is taken.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}, {\"id\": \"98b2486a-fcee-415d-b49e-9be7151f7aaf\", \"value\": \"<p> </p><h4><b>To join IATI and discover more about the benefits of becoming a member, visit our</b> <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/about/join-iati/\\\"><b>Membership section</b></a></h4>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

There are no restrictions on how people can use your data. Examples include:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\\\">Creative Commons CC0</a></li><li><a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/summary/\\\">Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)</a></li></ul><h3>Attribution-only licences</h3><p>With this type of licence, as with a public domain licence, anyone can share or adapt your data for any purpose, including commercial use. But they must give appropriate credit, provide a link to your licence, and note any changes they\\u2019ve made to your information. Examples include:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\\\">Creative Commons Attribution licences (CC-BY)</a></li><li><a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/summary/\\\">Open Data Commons Attribution License</a></li></ul><p>Some publishing organisations or government departments have to use specific licences. For example, UK government departments should normally publish using the <a href=\\\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/\\\">UK Open Government Licence</a>.</p><h2>How do I add my licence details?</h2><p>When you create a publisher account on the <a href=\\\"https://iatiregistry.org/\\\">IATI Registry</a>, you\\u2019ll be asked to select a licence.</p><p>If the licence you need to use isn\\u2019t listed, you\\u2019ll have to select an &#x27;Other&#x27; option. You can include further details about your licence and any attribution information in the IATI Registry \\u2018Description\\u2019 field.</p><h2>Where will I see my licence information?</h2><p>The type of licence you\\u2019re publishing under will be displayed in the metadata for each of your published files.</p><h2>Where can I find more information?</h2><p>There are several guides available on licensing open data.

This invaluable information enables the government to undertake work that was previously more difficult without the information available.</p>\\r\\n                            <p><strong>Effectively plan for the future</strong></p>\\r\\n                            <p>Government staff are better able to plan for the future by using forward-looking data from IATI to find out what donors are planning to spend in the country, up to three years in advance. Analysis from the government shows that over the last 10 years, IATI data revealed an additional USD 830 million worth of spending commitments, compared to data obtained by the government from direct requests to the same donors.</p>\\r\\n                            <p>The chart below shows a significant increase since 2015 in donor commitments that were found by using IATI\\u2019s online search tool, d-portal.org, compared with data in the government\\u2019s internal aid database, called the Aid Management Platform (AMP).</p>\\r\\n                            <p>As a result, government staff use IATI data to better plan and coordinate their domestic resources to complement the spending of external donors. For example, the Ministry responsible for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) has launched a database called TRACKFIN that uses IATI data to track down all financing to the WASH sector. This helps staff to better understand where service gaps or duplications may exist in the future.</p>\\r\\n                            <p><strong>Establish working relationships with more donors</strong></p>\\r\\n                            <p>The government uses IATI data to improve coordination with donors and other organisations who do not report their development or humanitarian activities directly to the government often because they do not have representative offices in the country.</p>\\r\\n                            <p>Currently, 38 organisations, from donor governments to multilaterals and NGOs publish information on their spending and projects to IATI, and their data are not included in Madagascar\\u2019s AMP. Their data represents an additional USD 288 million of spending commitments and over USD 300 million of actual spending and disbursements on development and humanitarian activities.</p>\\r\\n                            <p>Not only has additional funding been identified, but the government has also discovered organisations they had not been aware were active in Madagascar. With contact information shared through IATI, this has enabled government staff to make contact with them, and start working together to deliver a coordinated effort to help improve development effectiveness.</p>\\r\\n                            <p><strong>Save valuable time processing aid data</strong></p>\\r\\n                            <p>In a recent pilot undertaken with UNICEF (see below), government staff saved valuable time by trialing an IATI data synchronisation tool, since they were no longer required to input aid data manually into the Madagascar AMP. The tool automatically imported 118 development projects into the AMP, that UNICEF had originally published to IATI.</p>\\r\\n                        </div>\\r\\n                    </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n                    <div class=\\\"l-2up__col\\\">\\r\\n                        <div class=\\\"media-figure\\\">\\r\\n                            <img src=\\\"http://www.iatistandard.org/media/images/madagascar_casestudy_chart.original.png\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n                            <p class=\\\"media-figure__caption\\\">Chart name, <a href=\\\"#none\\\">original can be found at d-portal</a>.</p>\\r\\n                        </div>\\r\\n                    </div>\\r\\n                </div>\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"section-border\\\">\\r\\n                <div class=\\\"l-2up\\\">\\r\\n                    <div class=\\\"l-2up__col\\\">\\r\\n                        <div class=\\\"is-typeset is-typeset--no-trailing is-typeset--article\\\">\\r\\n                            <h2>What happened</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n                            <p>Within the Government of Madagascar, aid data is managed in the Office of the Prime Minister by the Permanent Technical Secretariat for Aid Coordination (STPCA). This body was created in 2008, along with Madagascar\\u2019s AMP (developed by Development Gateway), which became their first national database to manage data on aid coming into the country.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n                            <h3>Step 1</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n                            <p>In 2011 the Government of Madagascar signed the The Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation, strengthening its commitment to transparency and open access to development data.

During 2013, they started work on creating Oxfam Atlas as a portal to share IATI data and information on their projects, resources and lessons learned both within the organisation and to the public.<br/></p><h3>Step 1<br/></h3><p>By recognising there is strong business case for using IATI data themselves, Oxfam Novib decided to combine the goals of IATI publication with internal information sharing needs into one project. In May 2014 Oxfam Novib successfully published its first data set on the IATI Registry.<br/>They found that IATI\\u2019s requirement to publish data at individual project level has allowed for better internal sharing and disclosure on projects, which is particularly valuable in more complex organisations and confederations, like Oxfam.<br/></p><h3>Step 2</h3><p>In 2016, Oxfam Novib became compliant with the requirement introduced by their main donor, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to publish IATI data. Oxfam Novib also started using IATI data in the programme Power BI to visualise project trends in simple graphics for internal decision making.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

There are many details you can add about your activities and your organisation, including financial, contextual and results information.</p><p>IATI is not just about publishing data on official development assistance (ODA) \\u2013 ideally you should publish details of any activity to do with development cooperation or humanitarian work.</p><p>We suggest you start by publishing the <a id=\\\"85\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">mandatory and recommended</a> details (in the form of elements) and then <a id=\\\"84\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">increase the amount of detail</a> as you become more familiar with using IATI.</p><p>The <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/203/reference/\\\">Reference</a> pages on the <a href=\\\"http://iatistandard.org/\\\">IATI Standard website</a> give the full framework showing how to set out your data.

But with most <a id=\\\"78\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">publishing tools</a> you won\\u2019t need to use these pages.</p><h2>The two types of datafile</h2><p>You need to create two types of datafile: an Organisation File and an Activity File.</p><h3>Organisation</h3><p>All organisation information is published in an Organisation File.</p><p>This is the XML file you create to hold the details about your organisation, for example its name, its IATI Organisation Identifier (IATI Org ID), future-looking budgets, total expenditure and links to related documents such as annual reports and strategy documents. Budgets can be broken down by country and by individual organisation.</p><p>The IATI Organisation Standard provides the framework for how each detail should be reported. <a id=\\\"68\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">What goes in your organisation file</a> explains what this should include.</p><h3>Activity</h3><p>All activity information is published in an Activity File. This is the XML file you create to hold details of the activities your organisation carries out. You need to describe each activity \\u2013 for example: where it is based, how it is being financed, and what the outcomes are.</p><p>The IATI Activity Standard provides the framework for how each detail should be reported.</p><p>Each activity is identified by a unique activity ID, known as an IATI identifier. This is formed of your IATI Org ID + an internal reference.</p><p>For more about what an activity is and which activity details you should publish, see:</p><ul><li><a id=\\\"83\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">How is an \\u2018activity\\u2019 defined?</a></li><li><a id=\\\"85\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Key activity information to publish</a></li><li><a id=\\\"84\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">All the activity information you can publish</a></li></ul><h2>Updating your files</h2><p>Once you\\u2019ve committed to publish to IATI, it is most important that you update your data files regularly and in line with the frequency specified in your organisation&#x27;s IATI Registry account. Key points to follow are:</p><ul><li>Data should be added to existing activities. <b>Don\\u2019t</b> create additional new files that only contain the most recent information. Publish all information relating to one activity under that activity in the same file.</li><li>Each activity <b>must</b> have a unique activity ID (IATI identifier). <b>Don\\u2019t</b> publish the same activity ID/IATI identifier in multiple places.</li><li>Data should be cumulative. If you\\u2019re publishing every quarter, each activity should include data for the quarter being reported along with existing data from previous quarters. This will also enable you to amend your existing data as necessary.</li><li><b>Don\\u2019t</b> ever remove or delete data. Once published, your data should remain permanently available. But the IATI standard recognises that at certain points publishers&#x27; may need to correct incorrect data or merge activities. If you need to merge activities, you must ensure all the information is transferred across and nothing is lost.</li></ul>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

AIMS are generally owned by governments and populated with the donors\\u2019 data about the aid they are giving to that country.</p><p>Several different types of AIMS are in use in different countries. Most are supplied by specialist organisations, although several countries have built their own solutions.</p><h2><b>Benefits of using IATI data in AIMS</b></h2><p>Governments in developing countries are among the main users of IATI data. They need to know which development and humanitarian organisations are operating in their country and what they are spending, which services they are providing and where they are working.</p><p>IATI data provides a great deal of timely, forward-looking and detailed information on resources that flow into developing countries. Governments in these countries can access the data to inform policy decisions and planning to help address poverty, development needs and humanitarian crises.</p><p>Integrating IATI data into your AIMS brings a range of benefits that include:</p><ul><li>Allowing you to identify projects in your country that you were not aware of. This can lead to improved efficiency in resource allocation.</li><li>Providing you with data from more organisations, not just donors. For example, you can access information that NGOs have provided for the work they are doing on the ground.</li><li>Giving more timely and granular data on transactions. You will be able to identify what resources are being spent on a quarterly or monthly basis, depending on the frequency of publication of the specific organisation you are looking at.</li><li>Letting you see non-financial data on activities, such as the location, sector, results information and useful documents such as annual reports.</li><li>Saving valuable staff time for donors and recipients. Instead of manually gathering data and completing spreadsheets, data from IATI can be extracted in various formats and imported directly into your AIMS.</li></ul><h2><b>How do IATI and AIMS link?</b></h2><p>Developing country government staff can integrate IATI data into their AIMS.

This is not an exhaustive list. It has been compiled by the IATI Secretariat using information provided by partner countries.</p><h2><b>Examples of IATI data being used</b></h2><p>A number of pilot projects have already taken place, getting partner country governments to both import and use IATI data in their national platforms. This has often involved mapping the IATI standard and available data onto each country\\u2019s existing data and then importing the relevant areas. A couple of examples below talk about the successes and challenges of this work:</p><h3><b>Spotlight on IATI Data Use</b></h3><p>In 2017 UNDP, on behalf of the IATI Secretariat, carried out a survey looking at how eight partner countries were using IATI data. Country profiles were created to summarise each country\\u2019s IATI commitment, the progress they\\u2019d made in integrating IATI data into their national systems and how they were using the data. The profiles also highlighted the main challenges each country encountered and provided suggestions for how to increase IATI data use. See:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IATI-Profiles-Chapeau-English.pdf\\\">Summary of the project</a></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/spotlight-on-iati-data-use-new-profiles-launched\\\">Spotlight country profiles</a></li></ul><h3><b>Importing IATI data in government systems - Senegal and Madagascar</b></h3><p>Development Gateway, in partnership with Development Initiatives, supported UNICEF\\u2019s goal of helping their Country Offices use data published to IATI for reporting to their respective governments\\u2019 AIMS. The purpose of this was to reduce the Country Offices\\u2019 burden of data collection and reporting, increase the timeliness of data reporting, and improve UNICEF IATI data so that its usefulness for country systems and planning could be enhanced. The project started in June 2017 and focused around an import of UNICEF data during the pilot phase, which involved the placement, and training of two Aid Management Fellows in the foreign aid units of both governments.</p><p>Overall, the project showed that UNICEF\\u2019s IATI data had much detail and information that would be useful for the governments to include in their AIMS. You can read the <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/fullreport\\\">full report</a> about the experience and lessons learned. A <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/summary\\\">summary report</a> was also developed, which includes a series of questions and answers that development partners and government partners might ask when considering using IATI data in local AIMS.</p><p>Read more about Madagascar&#x27;s use of IATI data in this <a id=\\\"503\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">case study</a>.</p><h2><b>Share your experience of integrating IATI data into AIMS</b></h2><p>If you would like to share your experience of using IATI data and integrating it into AIMS, please add a new post on <a href=\\\"https://discuss.iatistandard.org/c/community-zone/iati-applied\\\">IATI Discuss community - Using IATI data</a>. We are aware there are many challenges in the process and would like to hear about how IATI data can be improved to meet the needs of partner countries.</p><h2><b>Who can help?</b></h2><p>If you want to integrate IATI data in your AIMS, talk initially to your AIMS provider about how best to achieve this with your particular system.</p><p>If you have questions about an organisation\\u2019s data, please contact the organisation directly.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

Among many celebrations taking place at the 2018 UN General Assembly, UNDP is co-organizing this important event to mark the 10th anniversary of the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).

This fundamentally supports UNDP\\u2019s own efforts to improve the effectiveness of development, and we\\u2019ve been fortunate to be engaged in this agenda ever since.</p><p></p><p>UNDP was instrumental in ensuring the voice of developing country governments informed the creation of the IATI Standard by holding extensive consultations throughout our network of programme countries. We engaged hundreds of government and civil society representatives from 79 countries to understand exactly what data was difficult to access.</p><p></p><p>We heard that the key data needs were for timely, comprehensive and forward-looking data on development spending and activities of donors and non-government actors. Having this data in an open, accessible format would enable officials in ministries of finance to align foreign aid with domestic resources in planning budgets and delivering on their national development plans.</p><p></p>\", \"id\": \"2d47c2a3-6378-41cf-993d-7090c075243f\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}, {\"value\": {\"image\": 414, \"caption\": \"<p>UNDP publishes detailed information, including results for more than 4,000 projects, on its own transparency portal, open.undp.org.</p>\", \"alignment\": \"media-figure\"}, \"id\": \"1e923054-e4db-42ec-9d16-ae382dc39a5c\", \"type\": \"image_figure\"}, {\"value\": \"<p>Ten years later, we\\u2019re proud to see that more than 850 organizations are now regularly publishing good quality data according to the IATI Standard that was established on the basis of those consultations. Numerous organizations have found countless new and innovative ways to analyse, visualize, consult and share IATI data. Beyond simply aid, IATI data now includes details on humanitarian spending, climate finance and private sector activities, and the Standard continues to evolve under the custodianship of 90 members to meet the ever-increasing demands of new users.</p><p></p><p>When IATI was established in 2008, the Sustainable Development Goals did not exist, and yet the Standard is flexible enough to now offer the means for donors to report on the activities they undertake in pursuit of the SDGs, and the results of those activities. This data will contribute to monitoring progress in achieving the Goals.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the work we do for the IATI Secretariat, UNDP has \\u2018walked the talk\\u2019, holding ourselves to the highest standards in our own implementation of the IATI Standard. We publish detailed information, including results for more than 4,000 projects worth more than US$5.5 billion. We make this information available through our own transparency portal, open.undp.org, as well as through the IATI Registry, opening our books to scrutiny and making us more accountable to our donors and partners.</p><p></p><p>We\\u2019re proud that our efforts have led us to be ranked among the top four most transparent development organizations in four successive independent Aid Transparency Index assessments, including top ranking for two consecutive years. We\\u2019ve worked to support other UN Agencies to implement IATI, following the commitment of the UN Secretary-General in 2017 to \\u201creinforce transparency on agency-specific expenditures and results through system-wide enrolment into the International Aid Transparency Initiative\\u201d.</p><p></p><p>So, what comes next for UNDP as we continue to support and strengthen IATI? We\\u2019ll continue to work with our government partners to raise awareness about the availability of data, ensure that they are able to access and use it, and that the content evolves even further to ensure their data needs are addressed. For our Administrator, Achim Steiner, and for our staff at headquarters and throughout our global network, transparency is an absolute prerequisite for development effectiveness and sustainable development results, and we\\u2019ll continue to step up the efforts of our own organization through our support to IATI.

Our sector has an initiative that does just that.</p><p>The <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/\\\">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)</a> open data standard provides a platform for sharing project data that is used across international development and humanitarian communities. The data provides an essential window into what projects are taking place where, who\\u2019s funding them and what results are being achieved. And this \\u201cbig\\u201d data is free and openly available for anyone to use. The initiative recently celebrated its 800th organisation as a data publisher and as of July 2018 there were 563 civil society organisations engaged in publishing.</p><p>Not only are civil society organisations sharing this data, they are also using it. Here are four ways IATI data is informing the sector\\u2019s work.</p><h2>Informing civil society</h2><p>How data informs the work of organisations is a key tenet in ensuring that the work being undertaken improves upon existing data processes.</p><p>Oxfam America\\u2019s Aria Grabowski has been working on a series of trainings with civil society and media groups in Uganda to engage participants in methods of data segmentation and analysis, which can provide them with more and better information.</p><p>Training participants using d-portal, a visualisation platform that provides data publishers and users with the opportunity to take a deep dive into IATI\\u2019s 1m humanitarian and development activities. Creating a training space such as this was vital in ironing out areas of uncertainty and provided the opportunity for participants to learn from one another.</p><h2>Informing journalism</h2><p>The visibility of IATI as a data source is gaining momentum beyond its use for data publishers themselves.</p><p>During this year\\u2019s World Press Freedom Day conference in Accra, data journalist Winnie Kamau and UNDP IATI outreach specialist Lea Zoric hosted a workshop for journalists. Building on the conference\\u2019s theme of sustainable development, journalists were guided through the data and were given examples of how they could use the information.</p><p>Reflections on the workshop were positive, with journalists keen to engage with the data for potential stories. IATI publishers were also encouraged to see this new potential use as an opportunity to improve upon the integrity of their data.</p><h2>Informing collaboration</h2><p>Plan Nederland has been working as part of the Yes I Do Alliance, comprised of five Dutch organisations working to address gender inequalities and social norms and who publish their datasets to IATI.</p><p>The organisation has used the business analytics tool Power BI to create a digital dashboard based on IATI data. The dashboard gives the consortium a timely overview of project progress and the delineation of the roles within the alliance. The use of the dashboard has allowed the consortium to have a centralised tool that provides key information along with a consistent structure of data that can be shared across organisations.</p><h2>Informing decision-making</h2><p>The global campaign for aid transparency Publish What You Fund has been advocating for the use of data to inform decision-making. They have provided examples of how to publish better foreign assistance datasets, based on a project exploring the potential impact of US foreign assistance cuts on four different countries.</p><p>As a first step, Publish What You Fund undertook a data landscaping exercise to understand who was doing what and where. The example of Cambodia reflected the importance of strengthening the datasets because of the difference in what was recorded between the Aid Information Management System (AIMS) and IATI (as shown below). The reason behind the discrepancy lay, in large part, due to the absence of disbursement information from a few key donors.</p>\", \"id\": \"c2f505d4-9dc8-4d23-8773-0679a7fd2a9e\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}, {\"value\": {\"image\": 433, \"caption\": \"<p></p>\", \"alignment\": \"media-figure\"}, \"id\": \"3ffea020-4fa9-4aa3-bb45-898c12776a5d\", \"type\": \"image_figure\"}, {\"value\": \"<p></p><p>IATI cannot be the single source of data but when used in conjunction with others it can provide key insights which other information management systems are not equipped for. \\u201cIt\\u2019s difficult to get a complete picture of aid flows into a country because not all donors publish their data in a comprehensive, timely, manner \\u2013 indeed some don\\u2019t publish at all,\\u201d says James Coe from Publish What You Fund. \\u201cHowever, where it is available it can still provide a lot of useful programme level insights.

Over the last two decades, pressure on the humanitarian \\u2018system\\u2019 has increased exponentially and that trend is showing no signs of abating (see Development Initiatives\\u2019 annual <a href=\\\"http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-report-2018/\\\">Global Humanitarian Assistance Report For 2018</a> to understand and learn more about the challenges that the humanitarian sector is facing).</p><p></p><p>The first of the original ten commitments within the Grand Bargain is to improve <a href=\\\"https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/greater-transparency\\\">the transparency of humanitarian financing</a>. All signatories committed to \\u201cpublish timely, transparent, harmonized and open high-quality data on humanitarian funding and to use the <a href=\\\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\\\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) to do so. In addition, Signatories also committed to improve how they use the available data to inform their own decision-making, learning and improve accountability.</p><p></p><p>We are now two years on from the signing of the Grand Bargain and progress is being made within the Grand Bargain Transparency workstream. The last two years of work has been primarily spent on working with Grand Bargain signatories in order to support and encourage them to a) start publishing to IATI if they were not already doing so or b) to help them improve the quality of their data by moving to <a href=\\\"http://reference.iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/overview/humanitarian-reporting/\\\">v2.02 of the IATI standard or later</a> so that they can start to use the specific humanitarian features that have been introduced into the most recent versions.</p><p></p><p>As a result 78% of all signatories are now publishing some open data via IATI and of these 89% are publishing data relating to their humanitarian activities (as at Sept 2018). However, monitoring of the quality of Grand Bargain signatory IATI data will continue via the <a href=\\\"http://46.101.46.6/dashboard\\\">Grand Bargain Transparency dashboard</a> in order to support and encourage continual improvement in published data quality.</p><p></p><p>However, while getting all Signatories to publish to IATI it is a critical first step in making more data available, it does not automatically translate to better decision-making or more effective responses to humanitarian crises. The data that is being produced must be used \\u2013 it must be turned into information, and used as evidence to inform and influence decisions about future humanitarian responses, ongoing resilience building and development work. It should also be used for improved accountability. As a result, the next phase of work for the Transparency workstream will focus on enabling and supporting IATI data use.</p><p></p><p>Central to data use for the humanitarian community is the <a href=\\\"https://fts.unocha.org/\\\">UN\\u2019s Office For Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Financial Tracking Service (FTS).</a> UN OCHA has a formal mandate (derived from an overarching <a href=\\\"http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/46/a46r182.htm\\\">UN Resolution</a>) and is therefore responsible for both coordinating humanitarian responses by the international community and tracking related financial information. As a result, the work of the Grand Bargain transparency workstream on data use is closely coupled with FTS and will focus on:</p><ul><li>Continuing with the IATI-FTS pilot to enable FTS to be able to automatically import published IATI data files into their systems rather than having to rely on organisations reporting that information to them via a (sometimes) manual and voluntary process. The pilot is already working with five organisations and will be looking to increase that number significantly during 2019.</li></ul><p></p><ul><li>Demonstrating to Signatories and the wider humanitarian community how IATI data can be used to answer some of the questions being asked within the Grand Bargain and exploited to underpin learning, accountability and subsequently help to highlight areas where efficiencies can be made.</li></ul><p></p><p>As you can see from the above, working with the Humanitarian community with regard to IATI data is an interesting and challenging area. Therefore if you want to find out more about any of the work mentioned then please do come to our session on this topic that I am presenting with Steven Flower who is coordinating the IATI-FTS pilot at the IATI TAG on Tuesday 13th November Session 8 at 15:50.</p><p></p><p>Alternatively if you are unable to make our session the please get in touch me Wendy Rogers Senior Business &amp; Data Analyst for the Grand Bargain Transparency workstream and Development Initiatives at <a href=\\\"mailto:wendy.rogers@devinit.org\\\">wendy.rogers@devinit.org</a></p>\", \"id\": \"e4e0dd6f-7e3f-42a9-b1cc-82bfd5174aea\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}]"

I had made dashboards using Power BI before, but this was a different beast: the alliance consisted of five partner organisations, all run in very different ways, all using different project management systems - or no project management system at all. Together they were the <i>Yes I Do Alliance</i>, a five year programme in nine countries, battling teen pregnancies, child marriage and FGM. A management report of this scale seemed like a challenge.</p><p>Luckily, we had IATI. The alliance was funded by the Dutch government, so IATI was a donor requirement, and all their data was already available in the IATI Standard format. I could use this as a source for my report and all would be well.</p><p>In fact everything went <i>really</i> well. We were on a tight deadline and I had not worked with xml files before, so I teamed up with Flores.nl, an IT company I have known for years, and together we made an effective dashboard in Power BI that is now used by the alliance. It has been a steep learning curve, but I\\u2019m very proud of the result.</p><p>However, we decided we could do much better. This dashboard was custom made for one consortium, and we spent a total of about fifteen working days to get it to work. For every new alliance, we\\u2019d have to do that again. Plus, not every organisation has a dedicated data analyst, with the time to work on dashboards like this. And of course, the IATI Standard is updated from time to time.</p><p>What if we could make a dashboard that would automatically visualise any IATI file? Instead of custom-made Power BI files, we would create an interactive online dashboard, full of visuals for any organisation\\u2019s IATI data. This is what we did. We worked on it this summer, and we are convinced it\\u2019s better, more interactive, more informative than its predecessor - and prettier. We named it <i>IATI Insights</i>. Organisations contact us, let us know which IATI files to use, and a few days later, the dashboard is ready. No need for a data analyst, no hassle with licenses or software, no training. We guarantee it will always keep up with the latest version of the IATI Standard - and older versions, if you\\u2019re a bit behind. And when in future we expand the dashboard to include new visuals, those will be available for all clients.</p><p>We made particularly sure that the dashboard works for consortiums and partnerships. After all, those are the situations where IATI can be most useful as a source for a dashboard. In this case, we need the parent activity ID that the alliance lead uses to link to the donor, and the dashboard with only the relevant activities is ready in no time, just like a single organisation dashboard.</p>\", \"type\": \"paragraph\"}, {\"id\": \"c77b6ccc-4eb7-4355-ae25-724282536770\", \"value\": {\"image\": 440, \"caption\": \"<p></p>\", \"alignment\": \"media-figure\"}, \"type\": \"image_figure\"}, {\"id\": \"5ac672b4-57ba-45c9-a98c-47e7d3310608\", \"value\": \"<p>A fully functioning demo is <a href=\\\"https://www.iati-insights.com/demo\\\">available on our website</a>.

msgid "[{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p><i>This post has been written by Kate Hughes, Technical Delivery Manager in IATI\\u2019s technical team at Development Initiatives.<br/><br/></i></p><p>Welcome to the IATI technical team\\u2019s new quarterly update. Based at Development Initiatives, it is our job to maintain and improve IATI\\u2019s core technical services that support the development and use of the IATI Standard.</p><p>Every quarter we\\u2019ll be letting IATI\\u2019s community know what progress has been made on IATI tech and what lies ahead.</p><h2>How tech priorities are set and monitored...</h2><p>Before diving into the work of the team, here\\u2019s a reminder of the processes undertaken last year to set our priorities and the governance around their implementation.</p><h4>IATI Technical Audit</h4><p>The latter half of 2018 seemed to race by for the technical team. Following the launch of IATI\\u2019s new website <i>iatistandard.org</i> at the <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/events/register-now-for-members-assembly-2018-un-city-copenhagen-9-11/\\\">Members\\u2019 Assembly in July</a>, a technical audit was undertaken. This was an important stock-taking exercise where we worked with a panel of experts appointed by the Governing Board to review the technical products that underpin IATI. Hosted by Oxfam Novib in August, the audit discussed and agreed on a single set of priorities.</p><p>Read the full <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/documents/665/IATI_Technical_Audit_team_report.pdf\\\">report</a> and a <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/news/board-decisions-on-iati-technical-audit/\\\">summary</a> from the audit\\u2019s co-chairs, John Adams and Leo Stolk (IATI Governing Board technical focal points at the time of the meeting).</p><h4>Quarterly Board reporting</h4><p>One of the agreements made at the technical audit was the need for the team to undertake regular work planning throughout the year. The panel agreed that creating an annual plan is less practical, as the different pieces of technology that are involved in making IATI run are completely interconnected; so a decision made in one area can totally change the work that lies ahead for the next quarter.</p><p>Moving forward, the IATI technical team are instead producing detailed quarterly plans to be reviewed and approved by IATI\\u2019s Governing Board focal points. At the end of each quarter we\\u2019ll report to the Board on what we have delivered against that plan and also draft the plan for the following quarter.<br/></p><h2>Update on last quarter...</h2><h4><b>All change\\u2026</b></h4><p>Over the last quarter we\\u2019ve been adjusting to an entirely new developer team, with John and Sam joining us in August and September. Although there is still a developer vacancy to fill, both have been brilliant at getting up to speed with the complexities of IATI tech and managing the workload whilst operating under-capacity.</p><p>We\\u2019ve also recently recruited Joshua Stanley as a new Business and Data Analyst and we\\u2019ll soon be adding his picture to the team gallery where information on all members of the team can be seen <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/who-runs-iati/technical-team/\\\">here</a>.</p><h4><b>Datastore</b></h4><p>We were excited to announce at the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting in November 2018 that Zimmerman and Zimmerman had successfully bid and signed a contract to deliver IATI\\u2019s new datastore. Whilst face-to-face in Kathmandu, we held a kick-off meeting to discuss the build of the new online data service that will provide timely, standardised access to all data published to the IATI Standard.</p><h4><b>Validation</b></h4><p>A core part of IATI, for both data users and data publishers, is validation. This is the process by which a publisher can check their data against the schema and know if their data meets the requirements set by the IATI Standard. The technical audit prioritised improving the validation service we offer to improve the quality of IATI data.</p><p>Over the last quarter the technical team investigated the different validation options already available and provided advice to the Board on whether a new tool should be built in-house or outsourced. Following this review, the decision was made to outsource the build of a new validator tool, so we detailed the requirements and worked with UNOPS to develop a <a href=\\\"https://www.ungm.org/Public/Notice/82318\\\">Request For Quotations (RFQ)</a>.</p><h4><b>Website</b></h4><p>As <i>iatistandard.org</i> was newly launched in July 2018, we carried on fixing and tidying up behind the scenes, but did no major work to the main website. We addressed requests from users to add a search feature, which we will be extending and improving in the coming quarter.</p><h4><b>SSOT</b></h4><p>The SSOT or <i>Single Source of Truth</i> is the collection of rules and descriptions about elements of the IATI Standard. Essentially it is the Standard itself and absolutely central to IATI. The technical team spent quite a lot of time exploring rules that are currently not machine-readable and, where possible, split them into smaller chunks to develop new machine-readable rules. This will (in the longer term) make it easier for publishers to check their data and therefore improve the quality of IATI data. We also worked on the development side of the tech, behind the SSOT reference site, to streamline any updates and bug fixes in the future.</p><p></p><h2>Plans for the start of 2019</h2><p>For this first quarter of 2019 we are building and consolidating the work that we did at the end of last year.</p><h4><b>SSOT</b></h4><p>We are going to spend more time on working through the SSOT, starting with v2.01, then v2.02 and finally v2.03. By making as many of the IATI Standard rules machine-readable as possible, we will ensure the new validator has clear logic to follow and automated checks of data are more thorough.</p><h4><b>Validation</b></h4><p>To build a new validation tool, we are working closing with UNOPS to ensure a vendor can be selected to deliver this work. The <a href=\\\"https://www.ungm.org/Public/Notice/82318\\\">RFQ is currently online</a> and we are available to answer questions that potential bidders may have.</p><p>The technical team will be part of the review committee that score the proposals and we will address any clarifications required as contracts are drawn up. We are hoping that at the end of this quarter contracts are signed and a kick-off meeting will have taken place.</p><h4><b>Datastore</b></h4><p>The technical team are managing the outsourced development of the datastore. As part of the datastore project, we have regular calls with Zimmerman and Zimmerman to discuss progress of the build and we will be preparing a couple of items for consultation with the community. We expect that there will be a first version for us to test within this quarter.</p><h4><b>French version of IATI website</b></h4><p>The team are working to create the first version of IATI\\u2019s website in French and plan to launch this over the next quarter. This was a request made by IATI members during the launch of the new site at the Members\\u2019 Assembly 2018.</p><h4><b>IATI Annual Report 2018</b></h4><p>The technical team will be supporting the delivery of the IATI Annual Report 2018 by pulling and analysing statistics to assess changes in IATI data quality over the last year. The report is scheduled to be released by April.</p><h4><b>Ongoing maintenance/support</b></h4><p>Our usual Monday Maintenance days will continue, where we will undergo non-urgent small tasks and bug-fixes, as well as reviewing requests from IATI\\u2019s community, including those received through github.</p><p>The Business and Data Analysts continue their ongoing support in answering queries via the IATI Helpdesk. They speak to 30 organisations every week and are always on hand to answer any questions you have about publishing and using IATI data.</p><p>We hope you find this update informative and look forward to sharing our progress made in our next IATI Tech quarterly update.</p>\", \"id\": \"2af39602-7761-49ad-ad1b-76ee2b0dce56\"}]"

Some of the projects from 2018 are outlined here:</p><h4>Importing IATI data into UN OCHA\\u2019s Financial Tracking Service</h4><p>The Financial Tracking Service (FTS) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Centre for Humanitarian Data, the IATI technical team and Development Initiatives are running a pilot project that aims to provide an automated way for organisations to publish information about their humanitarian funding and activities. Over the course of 2018, five organisations will trial using the IATI Standard to share data with OCHA\\u2019s FTS.</p><ul><li>See <a id=\\\"92\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Connecting IATI and UN OCHA\\u2019s Financial Tracking Service</a></li></ul><h4>Promoting IATI data at World Press Freedom Day</h4><p>At UNESCO\\u2019s annual World Press Freedom Day held this year in Accra, Ghana, IATI provided training to 40 youth journalists, showing them how to explore IATI data online through d-portal.org. At a stand in the conference centre many more of the 700+ participants learned about IATI for the first time and were shown ways to access the data.</p><ul><li>See <a id=\\\"93\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Promoting IATI data at World Press Freedom Day</a></li></ul><h4>Tracing US development flows to Ghana using IATI</h4><p>In early 2018 Oxfam and Development Initiatives released a report called \\u2018Tracing US development flows: A study of the traceability of US aid to Ghana\\u2019. The report provides a methodology, based on the IATI Standard, for carrying out a traceability analysis. The report also presents findings and recommendations on how IATI traceability can be improved.</p><ul><li>See <a id=\\\"118\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Tracing US development flows</a></li></ul><h2><b>Spotlight on IATI data use - profiles</b></h2><p>We want to understand our data users better and undertake research to gain insights into how they use data and what could be improved.In 2017 IATI released a series of profiles to look at the use of open data by developing country governments.Based on a recent survey led by UNDP, these profiles tell us a great deal about IATI data at country level and what the challenges and opportunities are for improving its use.</p>\"}, {\"type\": \"document_box\", \"id\": \"1b5dcde0-7a78-4b1d-9ff0-59c44e0e1e52\", \"value\": [{\"type\": \"document_box_heading\", \"id\": \"b46103ae-481b-4994-aa7d-452405f001a8\", \"value\": \"Spotlight Country Profiles:\"}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"46647e0d-9802-452a-a880-53e5e6f6e3ff\", \"value\": 486}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"229a30c8-f37b-45e9-b7e9-61ff146a0f6f\", \"value\": 487}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"f2b30fcf-6e4c-40ef-a415-5f92cac4eafb\", \"value\": 488}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"53f63c32-81f4-40ae-b3d5-117f8d447d26\", \"value\": 489}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"d11ea5e7-b91d-496c-a645-c6a96cb2d60e\", \"value\": 490}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"d18f8f08-2406-4ab6-a656-803ff121e580\", \"value\": 491}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"86fae2cf-02e0-467e-ae79-1182af53df12\", \"value\": 492}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"86c56291-610b-45ec-9bb8-0d36f506a01d\", \"value\": 493}, {\"type\": \"document\", \"id\": \"8b5dc83f-841c-42c5-aaa3-328f31671b2f\", \"value\": 494}]}]"

msgid "[{\"id\": \"fed09215-d9bd-468c-b72e-eed76bd4017c\", \"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p></p><p>In 2017 IATI launched a Data Use Fund with an initial budget of $250,000. The funding is available to members of the community who propose solutions to meet challenges identified by the Data Use Task Force and meet one or more of the five objectives of the strategy.</p><p>Innovative thinking is encouraged alongside practical solutions that will help people to use the available data. We encourage organisations working with IATI data to apply for funds to build sustainable features that help people use IATI data. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the fund\\u2019s official administrator and works with the Data Use Task Force to prepare Terms of Reference documents for each strategic objective. During each contracting period, proposals are welcomed from any organisation with ideas of how to overcome the barriers to data use.<br/></p><h3><b>IATI Data Use Fund Activities - update 2018</b></h3><p>Early in 2017, UNDP launched the IATI Data Use Fund (DUF) and announced a call for expressions of interest to promote the DUF among the community of development transparency advocates and champions. Following the announcement, more than 30 organizations and private sector actors signaled their interest to work with IATI on strengthening data use. Since April 2017, UNDP published four requests for proposals to provide the IATI community with opportunities to bid for innovative small-scale activities and participate in implementing the IATI Data Use Strategy.</p><p>Below is an overview of completed and ongoing activities funded by the IATI Data Use Fund:</p><h4><b>Theme 1 \\u2013 Awareness Raising</b></h4><p>Following the request for proposals (RfP) targeting awareness raising activities for IATI, two project proposals, one submitted by the Africa Open Data and Internet Research Foundation (AODIRF) based in Ghana and one from Oxfam America were selected for funding.</p><p>Funded by the DUF, <a href=\\\"http://www.aodirf.org/\\\"><b>AODIRF</b></a> organized a series of IATI workshops, organized in Accra, Kumasi and Ho, as well as a final hackathon held in Accra. The objective was to build the capacity of stakeholders on the use of IATI data, analysis and visualization, and to develop mobile applications to access IATI data.</p><p>In total, over 420 people from more than 130 different organizations, including government institutions from all sectors, media, academia and civil society participated in the events, which generated extensive national and local media coverage.</p><p>As a result of the DUF-funded activity, awareness on the availability of IATI data and use of data in open format was created among a diverse group of data users and open data advocates. Additionally, the activities provided a forum for traditional development practitioners to connect with private sector, developers and other data specialists and discuss the benefits of open data for sustainable development.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://www.oxfamamerica.org/\\\"><b>Oxfam America</b></a> conducted training sessions for selected civil society organizations in Uganda to strengthen their capacities around IATI data use. The specific interests of the CSOs, which included the Uganda Debt Network (UDN), Climate Action Network-Uganda (CAN-U), Africa Freedom of Information Centre (AFIC) and the Women and Girl Child Development Association (WEGCDA), were to start using IATI data to monitor development projects and share information to increase accountability and participation in community and public affairs.</p><p>Guided by Oxfam experts, the partners assessed and analyzed project documents found on <a href=\\\"http://www.d-portal.org/\\\">d-portal</a> to gather project details which were then fact-checked through conversations with key stakeholders, potential beneficiaries, and staff involved in project implementation. At the same time as becoming more familiar with the data, the participants shared their data use stories through social and traditional media, becoming valuable multipliers and advocates for IATI data use.</p><h4><b>Theme 2- Data Quality</b></h4><p>One issue central to the quality of IATI data is the connection between data users and publishers; it is essential therefore for users to have the ability to provide feedback on the quality and usability of data to the individual data publisher. Precise and direct feedback will encourage publishers to report high quality data designed to meet the need of the data user and thereby increase the usability of the data.</p><p>In order to conduct research on the possibilities of a web-based feedback mechanism and provide recommendations on how such a feedback mechanism could look like, a proposal by Nepalese company <a href=\\\"http://younginnovations.com.np/\\\"><b>Young Innovations</b></a> was selected for funding under this theme. The results and recommendations based on their research are expected at the end of February 2019 and subsequently a second RfP for the implementation of such a feedback mechanism will be published.</p><h4><b>Theme 3 \\u2013 IATI tools</b></h4><p>In Theme 3 <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/\\\"><b>Development Gateway</b></a> was awarded funding to develop an \\u201cIATI Tool Guide\\u201d to provide a comprehensive overview of existing IATI tools, including user-case scenarios and step-by-step guidance material. As part of this activity, DG analysts conducted comprehensive research and provided guiding recommendations in terms of gaps and development needs regarding IATI data use tools. More information on the IATI Tool Guide and downloadable material is available <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/news/cracking-open-the-iati-tool-guide/\\\">here</a>.</p><h4><b>Theme 4 \\u2013 User Guidance</b></h4><p>With the anticipated update of the IATI Datastore (currently being implemented by <a href=\\\"https://www.zimmermanzimmerman.nl/\\\">Zimmerman and Zimmerman</a> and expected to be functional in summer/fall 2019), activities related to this theme are currently on hold. However, comprehensive guidance on how to use the new IATI datastore will be required by the community, and requests for the design and implementation of related activities will be published in the first half of 2019.</p><h4><b>Theme 5 \\u2013 IATI-AIMS Integration</b></h4><p>IATI data use by partner country governments \\u2013 ideally through automated integration of IATI data into the national systems - is one of the main objectives outlined in the IATI data use strategy. Accordingly, one of the first RfPs published aimed to tackle this challenge and improve IATI data integration into national Aid Management Systems. Funded by the IATI Data Use Fund, <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/\\\"><b>Development Gateway</b></a> updated an existing IATI-AIMS integration tool in Senegal and trained selected Senegalese government and development partners\\u2019 staff on using the newly updated integration mechanism.</p>\"}, {\"id\": \"58f544bc-a4e4-4064-b101-b3a02e98dc9e\", \"type\": \"document_box\", \"value\": [{\"id\": \"922f934b-8140-402d-a798-547c81142471\", \"type\": \"document\", \"value\": 711}]}, {\"id\": \"6a45f766-5f3e-4849-aca3-71b94c1a342b\", \"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>For more information on the IATI Data Use Fund, the work of the task force or information on how to apply for finance from the Data Use Fund, contact Lea Zoric, IATI\\u2019s Outreach and Data Use Specialist: <a href=\\\"mailto:lea.zoric@undp.org\\\">lea.zoric@undp.org</a>.</p>\"}, {\"id\": \"6f9998bf-8ab8-4f43-82cd-1d61ca54a207\", \"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p></p><h3>Past news on the Data Use Fund</h3><p><a id=\\\"538\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">First IATI Data Use Fund awards issued</a></p><p><a id=\\\"540\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">IATI Data Use Fund Update: new RfP published</a></p><p><a id=\\\"90\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Submit proposals for Data Use Fund</a></p><p><a id=\\\"119\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">IATI&#x27;s new Data Use Strategy</a><br/></p>\"}]"

It does not contain the actual data, it only links to the published data, and to the metadata describing the contents of the files.</p><p>All organisations that publish to IATI have an account on the IATI Registry. If you are interested in how to publish data to IATI, see the <a id=\\\"13\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Guidance and Support</a> section.</p><h2><b>Who is the Registry for?</b></h2><p>The IATI Registry is primarily for data publishers. It is where they manage their organisation details and add links to their datafiles. However, it is also the place to find publisher contact details and with the necessary technical ability, it can be used to access raw datafiles via APIs.</p><p>You should be using the Registry if you are a user with technical expertise - say, a developer - who wants to access and import metadata and raw IATI datafiles. If you are not a technical user and simply want to search and view IATI data in a user-friendly way, please go to <a href=\\\"http://www.d-portal.org/\\\">d-portal</a> or find out about other tools at <a id=\\\"653\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Tools and resources for data use</a>.</p><p>IATI XML datafiles are in a machine-readable format that allows data to be exchanged between, and used by, a growing number of tools and applications.</p><h2><b>What information can I find in the Registry?</b></h2><p>The IATI Registry holds metadata about each organisation publishing to IATI and the files they\\u2019ve published in the IATI XML format. The files themselves are stored in different places across the web.</p><p>When you open the <a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/\\\">homepage of the Registry</a> you can see the total number of organisations that have registered with IATI and have published at least one datafile. The number automatically changes as the number of publishers grows.</p><p>The Registry metadata also lets all data users see a list of all organisations who have published to IATI, along with who their IATI contact is, where their files are hosted and the date they first published.</p><p>The IATI Registry contains sections for:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher\\\"><b>Publishers</b></a> - you can see a full list of all organisations that publish IATI data, including each publisher\\u2019s name, IATI organisation identifier, organisation type and the number of datafiles that they have published. If you click on an individual publisher, you will be able to see a list of their organisation and activity files with some metadata about each file, such as when it was last updated.</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/dataset\\\"><b>Data</b></a> - you can search the Registry by publisher name, publisher country, organisation type and recipient country. These are the metadata fields publishers have filled in to describe their organisation and the data they publish. The results that you receive will give you links to the raw XML data files.</li></ul><h3><b>How to find a publisher\\u2019s contact details</b></h3><p>Each IATI publisher should display an email address on the <a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher\\\">IATI Registry</a> and may also include a link to their website. To find these details, click on the required publisher\\u2019s page and the email address will be displayed on the right of the screen under \\u2018Contact\\u2019. There should also be a link to their website which often provides more contact information for the organisation.</p><p>Some organisations also include a specific contact email address for each activity. This can be found in their XML file. A way to check is to find the specific activity on <a href=\\\"http://www.d-portal.org/\\\">d-portal</a> and then select \\u2018View source XML\\u2019 beneath the activity \\u2018Project title\\u2019. In the source XML you can use CTRL + F to search for the word \\u2018email\\u2019.</p><h2><b>How do I get data from the IATI Registry?</b></h2><p>The IATI Registry is your single point of access for links to IATI data. You can access individual datasets using our built-in tools. More technically adept users can utilise our Registry API to access the metadata, including the URL for each published IATI file.</p><h3><b>Accessing individual datasets</b></h3><p>As well as letting you download individual XML files, the IATI Registry links to two data access tools. These are maintained by the IATI technical team.</p><p>When you are looking at the links to a IATI data file on a publisher\\u2019s page, you are given four options:</p><ul><li><b>View Metadata:</b> This allows you to view the additional information about the file, such as the file type, recipient country for the file\\u2019s activities and when it was last updated.</li><li><b>Download:</b> This will download the raw XML file.</li><li><b>The Preview Tool:</b> This allows you to quickly preview an IATI publisher\\u2019s data by presenting it in an easy-to-read format. It lists each top-level element on a seperate line, and allows you to expand the section to see the data it contains.</li><li><b>The CSV conversion tool:</b> This allows you to convert individual IATI activity files from XML into CSV format. You can do that by selecting one of three options. You can then download the CSV file to use the data for the organisation you have selected.<ul><li>Simple activity summary (CSV)</li><li>Full activity data (CSV)</li><li>All transactions (CSV)</li></ul></li></ul><h3><b>Using the Registry metadata API</b></h3><p>You can use an API to access all the metadata held on the Registry. The API returns data in JSON format. The Registry API is an implementation of the CKAN API - see the full <a href=\\\"http://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/index.html\\\">CKAN API documentation</a>. The URL to each published file is included as metadata on the IATI Registry. Once you have a list of the relevant URLs you can set up the process to import the raw IATI data.</p><h4><b>Usage examples</b></h4><p>To fetch organisation file metadata:</p><p><a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:organisation\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:organisation</a></p><p>To fetch activity file metadata:</p><p><a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity</a></p><p>These fetch calls will not return all results by default. You will need to select how many results you want to view by changing the offset and limit parameters. For example:</p><p><a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity&amp;start=100&amp;rows=100\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity&amp;start=100&amp;rows=100</a></p><p>To fetch an individual dataset metadata use its identifier. Full dataset details contain information on downloadable resources (i.e. the IATI XML files)</p><p><a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=aa-organisation\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=aa-organisation</a></p><p>The downloadable file details can be found in the resource.url field of the JSON response.</p><h4><b>Filters</b></h4><p>You can filter the responses on the basis of country (by ISO 2-digit code) or publisher (known as \\u2018organisations\\u2019 internally in the registry).</p><p>For example, to fetch all the activity file metadata from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) use:</p><p><a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=organization:dfid\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=organization:dfid</a></p><p>To fetch all activity file metadata that has Ghana as its primary segment, use:</p><p><a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity%20AND%20extras_country:gh\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity%20AND%20extras_country:gh</a></p><h3><b>API for XML data</b></h3><p>IATI offers several APIs. If you need an API to work directly with the IATI XML data, you can use the Data API with the <a href=\\\"http://datastore.iatistandard.org/\\\">IATI Datastore</a>.</p><h2><b>Who maintains the Registry?</b></h2><p>The IATI Secretariat is responsible for the maintenance of the IATI Registry and works directly with <a href=\\\"https://derilinx.com/solutions/ckan/\\\">Derilinx</a>, a leading provider of CKAN development and hosting, who supply and manage the Registry.</p><p>If you have any questions or notice any issues, <a href=\\\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\\\">contact the IATI technical team</a>.</p>\", \"id\": \"b9054cb8-7f92-4865-8007-f31a12ea76f6\"}]"

The alpha version is intended for user testing and feedback and, while you are encouraged to use it, it should not be considered a stable product.</p><h2><b>Why use the CSV Query Builder?</b></h2><p>Unlike a number of other IATI data use tools, the CSV query builder shows you activities and data that may be invalid, that is, they do not meet all the rules of the IATI data standard. This means you can sometimes locate data that is not presented by other tools.</p><h3><b>Key points</b></h3><p><b>Activities</b> - In IATI each activity ID should be unique. However, this is not always the case. Many tools, such as <a href=\\\"http://www.d-portal.org/\\\">d-portal</a>, will present only one activity result for each activity ID, whereas the query builder will display all the activities recorded for each activity ID.</p><p><b>Finances</b> - You can use the query builder to see details of individual transactions, or you can look at the aggregated finances for an activity, for example total expenditure or total incoming funds. The CSV Query Builder will let you know if a currency has been specified, if the result is in a mix of currencies or if the currency is unknown.</p><p><b>Filters</b> - Although the CSV query builder has limited filters to select from, you can always download a broader range of activities and transactions. Once these are in a CSV file, you can add filters to select only the data you want. For example, you could filter by the type of participating organisation, say, donor or receiver.</p><p>Users with technical expertise can work directly with the <a id=\\\"670\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Datastore</a> to create more complex or bespoke queries.</p><h2><b>Who maintains the CSV Query Builder?</b></h2><p>The CSV Query Builder is maintained by the IATI technical team. For help you can contact <a href=\\\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\\\">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p><p>For queries relating to the data itself, contact the relevant publisher directly. You can find all publisher contact details in the <a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/\\\">IATI Registry</a>.</p><p>The CSV Query Builder is the front end of the IATI Datastore. Due to current technical team commitments, the IATI Board decided in March 2018 to outsource development of a new Datastore. There is a clear need for a new product that provides a robust, timely and comprehensive data service that data use tools, such as the CSV Query Builder, can use.</p><p>Find out about <a href=\\\"https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/terms-of-reference-for-a-new-iati-datastore/1293\\\">the tendering process for the new IATI Datastore</a>, which is currently open.</p>\", \"id\": \"b6d6adf5-a278-4470-8561-723916f7cedb\"}]"

msgid "[{\"type\": \"intro\", \"value\": \"<p></p><p>Here are some steps to consider:</p><ol><li>Prepare the case for publishing to IATI</li><li>Assess the potential risks of greater transparency</li><li>Gain senior management backing</li><li>Create your project team and choose your IATI champion</li><li>Establish IATI publishing as a permanent business function</li><li>Prepare a post-publication communications plan</li></ol><p></p><p><br/></p><h2>1. Prepare the case for publishing to IATI</h2><p>You may have to persuade senior managers and others that publishing information about the work you do to IATI is right for your organisation. There are many benefits to this, including:</p><ul><li>improving your organisation\\u2019s profile \\u2013 by committing to IATI and sharing more information on your activities, financial transactions, resources and results, your organisation can be more accountable and build trust with stakeholders \\u2013 donors, beneficiaries, taxpayers and the public</li><li>communicating about your work \\u2013 IATI provides a channel and opportunity for you to inform a global audience about your ambitions and successes</li><li>improving internal processes and systems \\u2013 publishing to IATI can improve the data you provide to external stakeholders</li><li>improving interagency collaboration \\u2013 publishing better data on projects, in line with organisations who do similar work, can improve coordination and collaboration between agencies, reduce duplication of effort and improve use of resources</li><li>limiting opportunities for corruption \\u2013 publishing financial data makes it much harder to hide inappropriate payments or spending</li><li>addressing political pressures \\u2013 transparency and openness are central to policy discussions in government, and IATI is a way of delivering on commitments to be open and improve accountability.</li></ul><p>For more information about IATI and its wider benefits, see: <a id=\\\"27\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Why use IATI?</a></p><h2>2. Assess the potential risks of greater transparency</h2><p>You should assess and mitigate the risks of moving to a more transparent culture. Through publishing to IATI your organisation:</p><ul><li>may find its work and financial management are more closely scrutinised</li><li>must properly assess potential security implications of publishing data related to activities that may be sensitive because of their sector, type or location</li><li>should accept there may be costs in establishing a permanent business function for IATI publishing, or in adding this responsibility to an existing role.</li></ul><h2>3. Gain senior management backing</h2><p>You need to get buy-in from your senior management team or senior decision-makers at the beginning of the process as it is likely that publishing will require resources from across your organisation. Senior managers must endorse the risks and benefits of operating more transparently.</p><p>Publishing to IATI is not simply about sharing information but is an opportunity to increase the openness of the whole organisation. Organisations that have already published have learned that integrating IATI and other transparency measures into their practices can increase success and impact.</p><h2>4. Create your project team and choose your IATI champion</h2><p>To implement IATI sustainably, many organisations form a working group or project team to bring together relevant departments and integrate ideas and practical plans for publishing IATI data. This group should generally be formed early in the process. You should choose a group member to be the IATI champion and take the lead on IATI publishing.</p><p>Areas involved in the IATI process may include:</p><ul><li>finance</li><li>programmes</li><li>IT</li><li>legal</li><li>human resources</li><li>communications and marketing.</li></ul><p>The project team should also create and maintain a timeline for publishing data initially and then regularly.</p><h2>5. Establish IATI publishing as a permanent business function</h2><p>IATI publishing is not a one-off activity but must be repeated regularly. This may mean creating new roles, responsibilities and business processes and updating existing job descriptions.</p><h2>6. Prepare a post-publication communications plan</h2><p>Once you\\u2019ve published, who do you want to tell? Some organisations create a web page that includes information about IATI and their commitment to transparency. Some give details of their publishing via social media, e-newsletters, to the media and so on. You need to decide how you will tell your stakeholders that you\\u2019ve published.</p><p>Some organisations that have created specific IATI pages on their websites are:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-work/methods-approaches/open-information\\\">Oxfam</a></li><li><a href=\\\"http://www.afdb.org/en/topics-and-sectors/topics/quality-assurance-results/afdb-and-iati/iati-data/\\\">African Development Bank</a></li><li><a href=\\\"http://www.cdcgroup.com/disclosure-transparency.aspx\\\">CDC Group</a>.</li></ul><p>Do raise awareness and engage with IATI\\u2019s community of publishers and data users on the online forums <a href=\\\"https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/welcome-to-iati-discuss/6\\\">Discuss</a> and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/IATI_aid\\\">Twitter</a>, using the hashtag #IATI.</p><p>It can help to create an open information policy for the whole organisation. This will help identify all sources of information that can be made public and what could be published to IATI.</p><p>More information about creating an open information policy is available at:</p><ul><li><a id=\\\"57\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">IATI: Information and data you can\\u2019t publish (exclusions)</a></li><li><a href=\\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B32cSl_hOcDjRXdiTlRHZnRVUEk/edit?usp=sharing\\\">Bond Guidance - Developing an Open Information Policy: Guidance for NGOs</a></li></ul><p>For an example of an open information policy from a non-governmental organisation, see:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us/plans-reports-and-policies/open-information-policy\\\">Oxfam GB</a></li></ul><p>If you have any questions about preparing your organisation for data publication, please <a id=\\\"683\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">contact the IATI technical team</a>.</p>\", \"id\": \"cc5b2990-0dce-4a88-8703-12d4aff10070\"}]"

These give an overview of what data different organisations are publishing and how timely and comprehensive the information is. Most tables only look at live activities, so historic information is not included.</p><p>Above each table is an explanation of what\\u2019s included. Below each is more detail on the methodology for each calculation.</p><p>In IATI you should be publishing:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html\\\">Timely data</a><ul><li><b>Frequency</b>: Update your data at least quarterly. The Dashboard checks to see when you added a more recent transaction date. This counts as an \\u2018update\\u2019. If you\\u2019ve updated your data, the update will show in the relevant month. Please note if you\\u2019ve included future transaction dates at any point this will skew the figures. Transaction dates should never be in the future.</li><li><b>Time lag:</b> You can also check how up-to-date your data is relative to the first time you published it. You should aim to reduce the <a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness_timelag.html\\\">time lag</a> in your publication.</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/forwardlooking.html\\\">Forward-looking data</a><ul><li>Here you can see how many of your activities contain forward-looking budgets. Ideally 100% of your activities should have a budget for each year the activity is set to take place.</li><li>The table shows activities taking place, now and over the next two years, and the number of activities with budget for that year. Your data quality will improve as you add in more forward-looking budgets.</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness.html\\\">Comprehensive data</a><ul><li>These tables analyse which \\u2018elements\\u2019 you\\u2019re publishing for each activity, and therefore detail the work you\\u2019re doing.</li><li>The summary table gives an overview of your data.<ul><li><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_core.html\\\">Core</a> covers the basic activity data, largely those covered in <a id=\\\"85\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Key activity information to publish</a>. When looking at your data quality you first want to get your \\u2018core\\u2019 score as near to 100 as possible. This means for 100% of your activities you are reporting the \\u2018core\\u2019 elements.</li><li><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_financials.html\\\">Financials</a> covers your transactions and how well your data can be traced down and up to other organisations.</li><li><a href=\\\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_valueadded.html\\\">Value added</a> contains additional elements particularly useful to data users, such as sectors, location and results.</li><li>If under comprehensiveness, you notice a number in brackets e.g. 90 (100), the first number is the percentage of your activities that have the element reported correctly. The number in brackets shows those with the element reported but there is an error in some of them.

We looked back, before we looked forward, using post-it notes to create an IATI timeline going right back to 2008, and then brainstormed what we wanted IATI to look like in 5 and 10 years.</p><p>Tim got us moving for the \\u2018Attitude Finder\\u2019 session, by having us stand around a statement outlining a future goal for IATI, and then asking people to move to one side of the room if they agreed and the other side if they disagreed.

For example, there was an even split initially for the statement \\u2018In the future IATI needs to have a smaller core that everyone uses\\u2019.

This session drove home the point of how important it is to discuss and listen to others!</p><p>We spent a few sessions discussing the future of IATI\\u2019s community. We worked in pairs to discuss what makes a good community, mapped out what we think the community is and should be and discussed how it could change and improve in future. At the end we jointly worked on a \\u2018Rough Guide to IATI Collaboration Cultures,\\u2019 describing all the various ways that people involved in IATI work with one another.</p><h3><b>Technical sessions</b></h3><p>Although the focus of this meeting was input into the IATI Strategic Plan, when you get a bunch of technical experts in a room, you have to provide space for technical discussions as well. The second morning of the workshop featured an update on last year\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/news/board-decisions-on-iati-technical-audit/\\\">Technical Audit</a>, a presentation by suppliers of our forthcoming new Datastore and Validator, and a practical exercise on traceability.</p>\", \"id\": \"6c6a6a85-8c68-414e-9283-12da30f9b379\"}, {\"type\": \"image_figure\", \"value\": {\"image\": 548, \"alignment\": \"media-figure\", \"caption\": \"<p></p>\"}, \"id\": \"6fb3de24-3b17-4e62-8f21-7fc14b9e7d27\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p></p><h3><b>Open spaces</b></h3><p>Following \\u2018unconference\\u2019 principles the workshop also featured open spaces.

We had a wide array of spontaneous topics, including development of the Somali AIMS, defining the \\u2018core\\u2019 standard, reporting humanitarian data, the future of IATI\\u2019s Technical Advisory Group, guidance for IATI, user needs, improving the user experience\\u2026.

Since 2011, over 1000 organisations, from government agencies to NGOs, have used the IATI Standard to publish data on over a million activities. However there is growing demand for additional guidance on how to use and interpret IATI data for several reasons.</p><p>For one, new guidance documents are needed to help make the technically complex Standard easier to understand, particularly for non-technical audiences, thereby ensuring that IATI guidance materials meet the needs of all stakeholders. There is also a need to address gaps and inconsistencies in the Standard, which have arisen from the Standard\\u2019s expansion over time to reflect changing policy agendas and data needs. These inconsistencies and gaps have led to publishers interpreting and applying the Standard in different ways.</p><h4><b>Proposing recommendations and consulting the IATI community</b></h4><p>To create the new guidance, the Technical Team reviewed existing materials, identified inconsistencies or gaps and proposed changes for consultation with the wider IATI community. Community input happened by feeding back directly on 12 guidance pages, followed by two webinars to discuss the findings.</p><p>In this first round consultation, revising the guidance on some of the bread and butter (mandatory and recommended) elements of IATI, which are useful to all groups, from new users to those who want to check their interpretation of the IATI Standard, were prioritised. This covered how to report activity dates, geography, budgets and thematic areas (sectors).</p><h4><b>Many thanks to our community&#x27;s experts</b></h4><p>The consultative process allowed reflection from a wide range of stakeholders.

The new IATI Datastore aims to offer a robust online service, providing access to data published according to the IATI Standard. The IATI community provided feedback on the API via Github, which worked well and proved to be a successful way to test a product. Whilst the API testing was underway, we continued to work with <a href=\\\"https://www.zimmermanzimmerman.nl/\\\">Zimmerman &amp; Zimmerman</a> to develop the user-friendly Datastore Query Builder and prepare it for public testing in October.</p><h4><b>Validator</b></h4><p>We made considerable progress on preparing the new Validator with <a href=\\\"https://data4development.nl/en/\\\">Data4Development</a> for launch later in the autumn. This tool will allow publishers, users and developers to check if data published complies with the IATI Standard. The Technical Team tested the implementation of the IATI rulesets in the Validator this summer, creating XML test files for IATI rules to enable automated checks to be performed. Data4Development shared a staging site with us in August, to enable us to complete testing and provide feedback on the front-end design.

Previously the Dashboard took three days to update. Now, both tools can aggregate, crunch and rebuild the pages on a daily basis. This improves the user experience and will make it easier for the Technical Team to investigate and debug anything that does not function properly. <a href=\\\"https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/dashboard-and-publishing-statistics-split/1811\\\">More details are here.</a></p><h4><b>Website: iatistandard.org</b></h4><p>Throughout this quarter the Technical Team has continued to work with UX designers to expand the iatistandard.org website so that it can include the content currently held on <a href=\\\"http://reference.iatistandard.org/\\\">http://reference.iatistandard.org</a>.

New publishers should appear on d-portal on the Monday after their first publication.</p><p>d-portal is aimed at providing government departments, parliamentarians and civil society organisations in developing countries with information that can help with the planning and monitoring of development activities. It contains current data published to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as well as the most recent data available in the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Creditor Reporting System.</p><p>d-portal is in the process of being made multilingual.

Once you press \\u2018Search\\u2019 d-portal will present you with the total number of projects (called \\u2018activities\\u2019 in IATI). The total number is split by active, ended and planned projects. You will also be presented with information on where the money for the listed projects comes from as well as information on where the money is going by sector. For projects where IATI publishers have given location data, you will also be able to see the locations of these projects on a heatmap.</p><p>You can also combine the use of filters with a free text search by typing in the \\u2018Search\\u2019 box.</p><p>At the top right of your results pages you can use the \\u2018settings\\u2019 options to alter which currency, language and what 12 month period your results are displayed in.</p><p>Here are some examples of the types of questions d-portal can answer.

msgid "[{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>The IATI Registry stores information on every organisation publishing IATI data. These organisations are referred to as \\u2018IATI publishers\\u2019. IATI publishers register their accounts on the IATI Registry and publish links to their IATI data files there. The Registry provides a central point to access all IATI data files and import them into IATI data-use tools.</p><h2></h2><h2><b>What information can I find in the IATI Registry?</b></h2><p>The IATI Registry holds metadata about each IATI publisher and the files they have published in the IATI XML format. The files themselves are stored in different places across the web.</p><p>On the <a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/\\\">homepage of the Registry</a>, you can see the total number of organisations that have both registered with IATI and published at least one data file. This number automatically updates to reflect the growth in IATI publishers.</p><p>The Registry metadata also provides a searchable list of IATI publishers with their contact information, the location of where their IATI data files are hosted and the date of when they first published data.</p><p>The IATI Registry contains sections for information on publishers and all of the data published to IATI.</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher\\\"><b>Publishers</b></a> <b>-</b> you can see and download a full list of all organisations that publish IATI data, including each publisher\\u2019s name, IATI organisation identifier, organisation type and the number of data files they have published. If you click on an individual publisher, you will see a list of their data files (both organisation files and activity files), with some metadata about each file, such as when it was last updated. To understand what information is contained within IATI organisation and activity data files see: <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/preparing-data/what-data-to-publish/\\\">what data to publish</a>.</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/dataset\\\"><b>Data</b></a><b> -</b> you can search IATI datasets by publisher name, publisher country, organisation type and recipient country. These are the metadata fields to describe a publisher\\u2019s organisation and the data they publish. The search result will give you links to their raw data files, which are provided in XML format.</li></ul><p></p><h2><b>How do I get data from the IATI registry?</b></h2><h3>How to find a publisher\\u2019s contact details</h3><p>Each IATI publisher should display an email address on the <a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher\\\">IATI Registry</a> and may also include a link to their website. To find these details, click on the required publisher\\u2019s page and the email address will be displayed on the right of the screen under \\u2018Contact\\u2019. There should also be a link to their website which often provides more contact information for the organisation.</p><p>Some organisations also include a specific contact email address for each activity. An activity provides data on individual projects or single units of development and humanitarian work. Any contact information for an activity can be found within its IATI data file. Users can find the specific activity on <a id=\\\"656\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">d-portal</a> and then select \\u2018View source XML\\u2019 beneath the activity \\u2018Project title\\u2019. In the source XML you can use CTRL + F to search for the word \\u2018email\\u2019.</p><h3>How to access IATI activity and organisation data</h3><p>The IATI Registry is your single point of access for all links to IATI data files. You can use this tool to find the IATI file you want to download and do so in XML format or CSV format. More technically adept users can utilise our Registry API to access the metadata, including the URL for each published IATI file</p><h3>Accessing individual datasets</h3><p>When you are looking at the links to an IATI data file on a publisher\\u2019s page, you have four options.</p><ol><li>View Metadata: this allows you to view additional information about the file, such as the file type, recipient country for the file\\u2019s activities and when it was last updated.</li><li>Download: this will download the raw XML file.</li><li>Preview: this allows you to quickly preview an IATI publisher\\u2019s data by presenting it in an easy-to-read format. It lists each top-level element on a separate line, and allows you to expand the section to see the data it contains.</li><li>CSV: this allows you to convert individual IATI activity files from XML into CSV format. You can select one of three options and then download the CSV file to use the data for the organisation you have selected. The three options are:<ul><li>simple activity summary (CSV)</li><li>full activity data (CSV)</li><li>all transactions (CSV).</li></ul></li></ol><h3>Accessing all datasets via the Registry metadata API</h3><p>You can use an API to access all the metadata held on the Registry. The API returns data in JSON format. The Registry API is an implementation of the CKAN API - see the full <a href=\\\"http://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/index.html\\\">CKAN API documentation</a>. The URL to each published file is included as metadata on the IATI Registry. Once you have a list of the relevant URLs you can set up the process to import the raw IATI data.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li>To fetch organisation file metadata: <a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:organisation\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:organisation</a></li><li>To fetch activity file metadata: <a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity</a></li><li>These fetch calls will not return all results by default. You will need to select how many results you want to view by changing the offset and limit parameters. For example: <a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity&amp;start=100&amp;rows=100\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity&amp;start=100&amp;rows=100</a></li><li>To fetch an individual dataset metadata, use its identifier. Full dataset details contain information on downloadable resources (i.e. the IATI XML files): <a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=aa-organisation\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=aa-organisation</a></li></ul><p>The downloadable file details can be found in the resource.url field of the JSON response.</p><h4>Filters</h4><p>You can filter the responses by country (with an ISO 2-digit code) or publisher (known as \\u2018organisations\\u2019 internally in the Registry).</p><ul><li>For example, to fetch all the activity file metadata from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) use: <a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=organization:dfid\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=organization:dfid</a></li><li>To fetch all activity file metadata that has Ghana as its primary segment, use: <a href=\\\"http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity%20AND%20extras_country:gh\\\">http://iatiregistry.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=extras_filetype:activity%20AND%20extras_country:gh</a></li></ul><h3><b>API for XML data</b></h3><p>IATI offers several APIs. If you need an API to work directly with the IATI XML data, you can use the Data API with the <a id=\\\"670\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">IATI Datastore</a>.</p><p></p><h2><b>How do I publish my data on the IATI Registry?</b></h2><p>The first step is to create an organisation account on the IATI Registry and get this approved by the IATI technical team. Please see <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/preparing-organisation/organisation-account/how-to-register-with-iati/\\\">How to register with IATI</a> for detailed instructions.</p><p>Once your account is approved, you can add individual data files to the IATI Registry manually or by bulk upload using a CSV file. Or, if you are using a publishing tool to publish IATI data, there may be an option to automatically publish your files directly from the tool to the Registry. Please see <a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/publishing-data/publishing-files/how-to-publish-your-data-on-the-iati-registry/\\\">How to publish your data on the IATI Registry</a> for instructions.</p><p></p><h2><b>Can I get my organisation\\u2019s publishing system to interact with the IATI Registry?</b></h2><p>You can set up a system to interact with the IATI Registry using its own API, which is an implementation of the CKAN API. For details, see the full <a href=\\\"https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html\\\">API documentation</a>.</p><p>If you want your system to publish datasets on behalf of multiple organisations, you will need permission from the IATI technical team to do so. For further details and advice, please send a query to the <a id=\\\"683\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">IATI technical team</a>.</p><p></p><h2><b>Who maintains the IATI Registry and how can I contact them?</b></h2><p>The IATI Secretariat is responsible for maintenance of the IATI Registry and works directly with <a href=\\\"https://derilinx.com/solutions/ckan/\\\">Derilinx</a>, a leading provider of CKAN development and hosting, which supplies and manages the Registry.</p><p>If you have any questions or notice any issues, please contact the <a id=\\\"683\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">IATI technical team</a>.</p>\", \"id\": \"761f380c-d2ca-45b4-9532-27dc6e21e31d\"}]"

The tool works with the older <a id=\\\"670\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">IATI Datastore</a> and lets you obtain data directly in CSV format. It has pre-set filters for the most common data queries to help you get the information you want.</p><p>You can create IATI data queries based on who reported the information, where the activity is located, and the sector that the activity occurs in. You can also specify start and end dates to get data on activities over a specified period.</p><p>Once you have decided what information you want to query you can choose how you want the data to be presented. The options allow you to configure the way in which the data is disaggregated, making different sorts of analysis possible. You can have the data split by activities, transactions or budgets. And you can choose whether you want these further disaggregated by sectors or countries.</p><p>We are in the process of outsourcing the development of a new Datastore. The current Datastore is an alpha version, which means that it does not yet contain all the planned features and may return unexpected results.This is also true for the CSV Query Builder. The alpha version is intended for user testing and feedback and, while you are encouraged to use it, it should not be considered a stable product.</p><h2><b>Why use the CSV Query Builder?</b></h2><p>Unlike a number of other IATI data use tools, the CSV query builder shows you activities and data that may be invalid, that is, they do not meet all the rules of the IATI data standard. This means you can sometimes locate data that is not presented by other tools.</p><h3><b>Key points</b></h3><p><b>Activities</b> - In IATI each activity ID should be unique. However, this is not always the case. Many tools, such as <a href=\\\"http://www.d-portal.org/\\\">d-portal</a>, will present only one activity result for each activity ID, whereas the query builder will display all the activities recorded for each activity ID.</p><p><b>Finances</b> - You can use the query builder to see details of individual transactions, or you can look at the aggregated finances for an activity, for example total expenditure or total incoming funds. The CSV Query Builder will let you know if a currency has been specified, if the result is in a mix of currencies or if the currency is unknown.</p><p><b>Filters</b> - Although the CSV query builder has limited filters to select from, you can always download a broader range of activities and transactions. Once these are in a CSV file, you can add filters to select only the data you want. For example, you could filter by the type of participating organisation, say, donor or receiver.</p><p>Users with technical expertise can work directly with the <a id=\\\"670\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Datastore</a> to create more complex or bespoke queries.</p><h2><b>Who maintains the CSV Query Builder?</b></h2><p>The CSV Query Builder is maintained by the IATI technical team and will continue to run for six months following the release of the new <a id=\\\"670\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">IATI Datastore</a>. For help you can contact <a href=\\\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\\\">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p><p>For queries relating to the data itself, contact the relevant publisher directly. You can find all publisher contact details in the <a href=\\\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/\\\">IATI Registry</a>.</p><p>The CSV Query Builder is the front end of the IATI Datastore. Due to current technical team commitments, the IATI Board decided in March 2018 to outsource development of a new Datastore. There is a clear need for a new product that provides a robust, timely and comprehensive data service that data use tools, such as the CSV Query Builder, can use.</p>\", \"id\": \"912b271c-5af1-4bad-bcd0-ae1283d2c2f5\"}]"

AIMS are generally owned by governments and populated with the donors\\u2019 data about the aid they are giving to that country.</p><p>Several different types of AIMS are in use in different countries. Most are supplied by specialist organisations, although several countries have built their own solutions.</p><h2><b>Benefits of using IATI data in AIMS</b></h2><p>Governments in developing countries are among the main users of IATI data. They need to know which development and humanitarian organisations are operating in their country and what they are spending, which services they are providing and where they are working.</p><p>IATI data provides a great deal of timely, forward-looking and detailed information on resources that flow into developing countries. Governments in these countries can access the data to inform policy decisions and planning to help address poverty, development needs and humanitarian crises.</p><p>Integrating IATI data into your AIMS brings a range of benefits that include:</p><ul><li>Allowing you to identify projects in your country that you were not aware of. This can lead to improved efficiency in resource allocation.</li><li>Providing you with data from more organisations, not just donors. For example, you can access information that NGOs have provided for the work they are doing on the ground.</li><li>Giving more timely and granular data on transactions. You will be able to identify what resources are being spent on a quarterly or monthly basis, depending on the frequency of publication of the specific organisation you are looking at.</li><li>Letting you see non-financial data on activities, such as the location, sector, results information and useful documents such as annual reports.</li><li>Saving valuable staff time for donors and recipients. Instead of manually gathering data and completing spreadsheets, data from IATI can be extracted in various formats and imported directly into your AIMS.</li></ul><h2><b>How do IATI and AIMS link?</b></h2><p>Developing country government staff can integrate IATI data into their AIMS. Depending on what aid information management system they are using, data can be:</p><ul><li>Imported manually</li><li>Imported automatically using an IATI-AIMS import tool</li></ul><p>We have <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-Di5-CSL7uxq0IWCxOgQuv-L5_Aum9f3akGWxsILzI/edit#gid=2053551143\\\">a list of developing countries showing which AIMS provider they use</a>. This is not an exhaustive list. It has been compiled by the IATI Secretariat using information provided by partner countries.</p><h2><b>Examples of IATI data being used</b></h2><p>A number of pilot projects have already taken place, getting partner country governments to both import and use IATI data in their national platforms. This has often involved mapping the IATI standard and available data onto each country\\u2019s existing data and then importing the relevant areas. A couple of examples below talk about the successes and challenges of this work:</p><h3><b>Spotlight on IATI Data Use</b></h3><p>In 2017 UNDP, on behalf of the IATI Secretariat, carried out a survey looking at how eight partner countries were using IATI data. Country profiles were created to summarise each country\\u2019s IATI commitment, the progress they\\u2019d made in integrating IATI data into their national systems and how they were using the data. The profiles also highlighted the main challenges each country encountered and provided suggestions for how to increase IATI data use. See:</p><ul><li><a id=\\\"153\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">Summary of the project</a></li><li><a href=\\\"https://iatistandard.org/documents/494/Country_Profiles_-_Summary_Note.pdf\\\">Spotlight country profiles</a></li></ul><h3><b>Importing IATI data in government systems - Senegal and Madagascar</b></h3><p>Development Gateway, in partnership with Development Initiatives, supported UNICEF\\u2019s goal of helping their Country Offices use data published to IATI for reporting to their respective governments\\u2019 AIMS. The purpose of this was to reduce the Country Offices\\u2019 burden of data collection and reporting, increase the timeliness of data reporting, and improve UNICEF IATI data so that its usefulness for country systems and planning could be enhanced. The project started in June 2017 and focused around an import of UNICEF data during the pilot phase, which involved the placement, and training of two Aid Management Fellows in the foreign aid units of both governments.</p><p>Overall, the project showed that UNICEF\\u2019s IATI data had much detail and information that would be useful for the governments to include in their AIMS. You can read the <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/fullreport\\\">full report</a> about the experience and lessons learned. A <a href=\\\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/summary\\\">summary report</a> was also developed, which includes a series of questions and answers that development partners and government partners might ask when considering using IATI data in local AIMS.</p><p>Read more about Madagascar&#x27;s use of IATI data in this <a id=\\\"503\\\" linktype=\\\"page\\\">case study</a>.</p><h2><b>Share your experience of integrating IATI data into AIMS</b></h2><p>If you would like to share your experience of using IATI data and integrating it into AIMS, please add a new post on <a href=\\\"https://discuss.iatistandard.org/c/community-zone/iati-applied\\\">IATI Discuss community - Using IATI data</a>. We are aware there are many challenges in the process and would like to hear about how IATI data can be improved to meet the needs of partner countries.</p><h2><b>Who can help?</b></h2><p>If you want to integrate IATI data in your AIMS, talk initially to your AIMS provider about how best to achieve this with your particular system.</p><p>If you have questions about an organisation\\u2019s data, please contact the organisation directly.</p>\", \"id\": \"7757a838-40f8-4bd3-a2de-3d57abc8e31d\"}]"

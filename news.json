This includes in particular aid/development watchdog organizations, journalists and other media actors, and parliamentarians.\u201d</p><p><strong>Theme 3:</strong> <a href=\"http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=46822\">User-friendly IATI tools</a></p><p>UNDP/IATI is seeking to contract a service provider, who has the capacity to plan, present and implement an innovative and effective small-scale activity that addresses the key challenge: \u201cDevelop a set of data use guides/cookbooks based on current tools and addressing specific personas.\u201d</p><p><strong>Theme 5:</strong> <a href=\"http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=46823\">IATI-Aid Information Management Systems Integration</a></p><p>UNDP/IATI is seeking to contract a service provider, who has the capacity to plan, present and implement an innovative and effective small-scale activity that addresses the key challenge: \u201cIATI data is not broadly integrated into national aid management platforms and systems\u201d.</p><p>Previous studies and pilots shown that there are still some building blocks missing before integrating IATI data into national systems. The reasons for IATI data not being systematically and/or automatically integrated into national aid management systems, databases and platforms, are numerous but can mostly be associated with technical barriers such as different reporting and/or financial cycles, lack of trust in the reliability of IATI data and technical capacity.</p><p><strong>Deadline \u2013 12 June 2018</strong></p><p>UNDP and IATI are looking forward to receiving innovative and detailed proposals. The deadline is 12 June 2018. Please do not hesitate to contact us: info@iatistandard.org with any questions and suggestions regarding the IATI Data Use Fund and the published RfPs.</p>",

        "content": "<p><em>This blog was co-written by the IATI-FTS Pilot Team consisting of UN OCHA\u2019s Financial Tracking Service, The Centre for Humanitarian Data, the International Aid Transparency Initiative and Development Initiatives. </em></p><p>OCHA\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS), the Centre for Humanitarian Data, IATI technical team and Development Initiatives are running a pilot project that aims to provide an automated way for organisations to publish information about their humanitarian funding and activities. Over the course of 2018, five organizations will trial using the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard to share data with OCHA\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS).</p><p>This work is in support of the <a href=\"https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/grand-bargain-hosted-iasc\">Grand Bargain</a>, an agreement between over 50 of the largest donors and aid agencies, which includes commitments on greater financial transparency and more harmonised and simplified reporting requirements. IATI has been identified as the international standard for publishing open data on humanitarian aid and FTS as the platform for reporting how humanitarian funding is allocated and used.</p><p>The latest version of the IATI Standard, released in February 2018, (<a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/iati-upgrade-to-version-2-03-goes-live\">version 2.03</a>) enables organisations to publish more granular data on their humanitarian activities, such as earmarked funding, pledges, humanitarian clusters and cash transfers, and whether funding is channelled via local and national responders. Over <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/700-organisations-have-published-iati-data\">750 humanitarian and development organisations</a> currently publish their data using the IATI Standard.</p><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6395 alignright\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/USAID-FTS-IATI-pilot-4.png\" width=\"336\"/>FTS monitors the funding progress against humanitarian response plans and appeals which amounted to $25 billion in 2018 alone. Reporting to FTS is voluntary, and as a result, the service does not always have a complete picture. The majority of organisations provide funding data to FTS through manual, often ad-hoc processes. Since many organisations already publish data on development spending via IATI, use of the standard for humanitarian spending will reduce duplicate reporting and create internal efficiencies and cost savings.</p><p>Current participants for the pilot include the International Rescue Committee, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, OCHA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.unocha.org/our-work/humanitarian-financing/country-based-pooled-funds-cbpfs\">Country-based Pooled Funds</a>, the UK Department for International Development, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</p><p>The pilot includes the following components:</p><ul>\n<li>Support to pilot partners to modify their existing financial and activity reporting systems (or creating new ones).</li>\n<li>Integrating the new reporting streams into FTS, and testing FTS\u2019s recently-developed IATI ingestion module.</li>\n<li>Developing technical guidelines for reporting humanitarian funding to FTS using IATI.</li>\n<li>Training and outreach events, including an IATI-FTS technical meeting with partners.</li>\n</ul><p>After the pilot period, we will continue to support organisations to use IATI for FTS reporting, in line with IATI\u2019s \u2018publish once, use often\u2019 approach. The long-term goal is for the majority of organisations to use IATI to report on both their development and humanitarian spending.</p><p>We look forward to sharing lessons, experiences and updates in the coming months, and to connect with other organisations that might be interested in participating. To learn more or join the next phase of the project, please contact Eleonore Fournier-Tombs, IATI Technical Specialist with OCHA\u2019s Centre for Humanitarian Data: <a href=\"mailto:centrehumdata@un.org\">centrehumdata@un.org</a>.</p>",

The government of Nepal, supported by development partners, has established the Aid Management Platform (AMP) and launched its public website. Several other platforms and initiatives have been put in place by various actors with the aim of providing aid-related and humanitarian information, in particular following the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. This reflects a growing demand for increased production, sharing and use of data to meet development aims, as well as improved transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>Internationally, there has also been an increase in the availability and quality of data. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) now has more than 600 bilateral, multilateral, non-government and private sector development partners publishing data to its standard. The Data Revolution has brought the role of data in meeting and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to the fore. What is less clear, is the extent to which aid data is being used, by whom and for what purpose, and it is this that the discussion paper seeks to investigate for the specific case of aid information use in one country.</p>\n<p>This discussion paper highlights information needs of different stakeholder groups to assist user-centred approaches to providing data on aid finance, considers the potential role of data published to the IATI Standard in this context, and builds interest in increased use of data on aid finance among key stakeholder groups.</p>\n<h2>Key findings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Many stakeholders share common interests and needs with regard to financial information on aid. There is a shared motivation to understand how aid is allocated, spent and what results it contributes to.</li>\n<li>There is a demand for more analytical information, in particular on needs, resources and results of development interventions; aid in relation to national SDGs and other indicators; and aid in relation to domestic resources.</li>\n<li>Despite the increase in availability of aid data from national and international sources and platforms, in practice stakeholders rely strongly on written reports, organisational websites and their interpersonal networks to access and use the information they need.</li>\n<li>Greater efforts are needed to increase the awareness of aid data availability from the AMP and IATI, and to engage proactively with different user groups and intermediaries who can support the translation of data into actionable analysis. Ideally this would build on existing information and communication preferences, and coordination fora to enhance these with better data and analysis.</li>\n<li>For this, openness of aid data and its interoperability with other sources of official and administrative data is critical.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"pdf-download\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Aid-data-needs-and-use-cases-in-Nepal.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Aid-data-needs-and-use-cases-in-Nepal.pdf\">Download </a><em><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Aid-data-needs-and-use-cases-in-Nepal.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Aid data needs and use cases in Nepal\">Aid data needs and use cases in Nepal\u00a0</a></em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-6289\" height=\"173\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nepal-aid-data-needs-and-use-cases-cover.png\" style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: 300;\" width=\"121\"/><em>This discussion paper was co-authored by Conrad Zellmann of DI and Kishor Pradhan, an in</em><em>dependent con</em><em>sultant.

The new website is seeking to solve problems such as this.</p><p><strong>Discovery</strong><br/>\nThe website journey started last year with extensive discovery work about IATI, including 100+ interviews, usability testing and focus groups. The UX agency <em>fffunction</em>, has been brilliant at consolidating this work into user personas. These are a set of profiles to ensure we understand who each of our key users are, and what they are trying to achieve when they visit the IATI website.</p><p>We have created 10 key personas, which may sound like quite a lot, but the IATI community emcompasses a wide range of stakeholders. A core part of the persona work has been to establish the difficulties, or pain points experienced, that need to be overcome in the new site.</p><p><strong>User journeys</strong><br/>\nFor the next stage of the project, the personas were used to create specific journeys that different people want to take through the website.

A user would expect these projects to be included when searching \u201call projects in country A\u201d through a map. However, visualising such projects on a map in an intuitive manner can be a challenge.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some basic dos and don\u2019ts for designating national-level projects in the IATI standard \u2013 spelled out in IATI\u2019s guidance \u2013 that most parties more or less agree on. The country where development projects (referred to as \u201cactivities\u201d in the IATI Standard) take place should always be input in IATI\u2019s \u201c</span><a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/recipient-country/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recipient Country</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d field. The \u201c</span><a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/activity-scope/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Activity Scope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d field should be used to denote that a project is being implemented at the \u201c</span><a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/activity-scope/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National level</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d However, there was a question on whether publishers should also list the country and its coordinates in the </span><a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/location/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Location</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> section of the standard. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI guidance clearly states that the \u201cLocation\u201d field is for \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the sub-national geographical identification of the target locations of an activity\u2026\u201d This suggests that national level information should not be added here. However, some organisations expressed concern that their scores on indices such as the </span><a href=\"http://ati.publishwhatyoufund.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aid Transparency Index</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would be dinged for leaving this information out, and thus decided to enter centroid coordinates for the entire country in the \u201cLocation\u201d field. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why does all this matter? When tools are created to visualise IATI location data, if these complexities are not considered, data can be misrepresented. For example, if centroid points for national level projects are entered without clearly indicating that they represent a national level project, it can seem like there are a large number of projects taking place in the middle of the country when that isn\u2019t really the case. Many suggested that when representing data on maps, national activities (be they general budget support, policy interventions, etc.), should be considered wholly separate from activities that happen in or benefit specific areas \u201con the ground,\u201d but again, the risk is that not visualising national level activities drastically understates the story of aid in that country.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the challenge can best be represented by a simplistic thought exercise:</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretend you\u2019re working in country X, region Y, district Z (in other words, X contains Y, and Y contains Z). </span></i></span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is one national-level policy-based initiative being implemented in country X, a health program occurring throughout region Y, and a small capacity-building project happening in district Z. </span></i></span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many projects are being implemented in district Z? </span></i></span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><em>A) 1</em></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #999999;\"><em> B) 2</em></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #999999;\"><em> C) 3</em></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #999999;\"><em> D) It depends\u2026</em></span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, a fourth project is training teachers from region Y in the main city of a neighboring region, call it region W. Now, how many projects would you say benefit people in district Z?</span></i></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what\u2019s the solution? </span></p><ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When building a mapping tool, it is critical to take into consideration the \u201cActivity Scope\u201d and appropriately handle national level projects, either by not including them, </span><a href=\"https://aidtransparency.gov.tl/TEMPLATE/ampTemplate/gisModule/dist/index.html#saved/246\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">layering and labeling them separately</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the map, or by listing them separately. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, transparency indices should take into account the activity scope to make sure that national level projects don\u2019t lose points on their score.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publishers should then confidently follow the IATI definition to only use the location section for sub-national locations, and use the recipient country and activity scope to denote national level projects.</span></li>\n</ol><p><span style=\"color: #b6c400;\"><b>Points vs. Polygons</b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently the IATI standard allows publishers to enter latitude and longitude, along with additional information such as the </span><a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/GeographicLocationClass/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geographic Class</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which allows users to understand if the listed location is an Administrative Region, a Populated Place (eg. city or village), a structure, or another type of location; and the </span><a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/GeographicLocationReach/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geographic Location Reach</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which indicates whether the location relates to the activities or the beneficiaries of the project. With the addition of the </span><a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/location/location-id/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GeoID</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, locations that are administrative divisions, and perhaps better represented by the shape/polygon of the admin location, can be linked back to the polygon rather than entering latitude and longitude. However, IATI does not itself store the polygons. This means that the developers of the visualisation platform have to not only perform this linking on their end, but also find an appropriate source to use for importing shapefiles (for instance, </span><a href=\"http://www.gadm.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GADM</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, for projects </span><b><i>coded </i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at an Admin level, there still remains the question of whether admin levels should be </span><b><i>displayed </i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as points or as polygons when developing GIS tools. The discussion resulted in agreement that it depends on the purpose of the tool, but no matter what, locations should be clearly labeled with the level (Geographic Class) to which they are coded. For example, users should be able to either select between geographic class, or classes should be differentiated by different shapes, colors, or other visual clues. Highlighting polygons makes it clear that project activities benefit or take place throughout the admin level, however, this can limit the ability to layer it with other types of contextual data, such as fertility, malnutrition, or poverty rates, all of which are frequently represented as shades of color within a polygon.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: #b6c400;\"><b>Matching Results to Locations</b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was noted that the standard does not currently allow results to be linked to locations, so we\u2019re unable to disaggregate indicators geographically. That may be forgivable/unnecessary for programs that are implemented more or less uniformly across different areas (i.e. teachers trained in every district within the project area), but it becomes trickier when specific interventions are differentiated by locations (i.e. teachers are trained in some districts, but in others the focus is on other aspects like in-class technology). This is important information for those trying to identify what has taken place at each location and what the results where, instead of inferences being made that might not be correct. On the other hand, this may very well be an edge case that would add further complexity to the IATI standard in order to accomodate.</span></p><p><b>Is it safe to publish locations?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concerns over security were shared if location data could possibly connect to results or other data shared that could have private, sensitive data. It was noted that geocoding activities at a slightly higher level can help avoid these issues. Slightly more technical publishers may wish to consider other methodologies, such as the </span><a href=\"https://dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/GPS-Data-Collection.cfm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">random geographic displacement algorithm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) use to obscure the locations of respondents while maintaining a high level of geographic detail.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: #b6c400;\"><b>What tools are there for producing/publishing location data?</b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some organisations, such as World Bank and UNDP, shared how their internal project management systems allow for project managers to enter location information, and are typically linked to </span><a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geonames</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (an geographic database and gazetteer) to produce the rest of the information needed to publish to IATI. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Development Gateway has also created an Autogeocoder tool that allows for uploading documents that contain location information. The tool reads through the documents and suggests locations for the user to validate or supplement with additional information. The tool has been implemented in the Initiative for Open Ag\u2019s </span><a href=\"http://www.openag.org.uk/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publisher\u2019s Toolchain</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and soon a standalone geocoding tool will be launched which integrates autogeocoding with an existing manual geocoding platform. The tool is open source and will be available for organisations to plug into their own systems or to use the standalone system within their own processes. We are eager to share this tool as soon as it is live!</span></p>",

The document sets out how we can improve the use of data on over 700,000 aid, development and humanitarian activities that are published to the IATI Standard. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u00a0strategy will seek to increase the use of IATI by partner countries through integrating data into government processes and systems to inform decision-making. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bilateral and multilateral donors, CSOs and journalists are amongst other important users who could use IATI data for coordination, transparency and accountability. </span></p><h3><b>Our key objectives</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Data Use Strategy has been informed by extensive research in 2016/17 on the barriers that prevent user groups from benefiting from IATI </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(see Annex II). We have set five key objectives to help overcome these challenges:</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>Objective 1</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Raise awareness of IATI as a source of aid data and develop a common understanding of the priority needs of different user groups.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>Objective 2</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Improve data quality in order to facilitate use, and assure users of its reliability, including through the development of feedback mechanisms.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>Objective 3</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Improve existing tools and develop new, user-friendly tools that help multiple actors access and use IATI data;</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>Objective 4</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Improve guidance, training and support for specific user groups; \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>Objective 5: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promote integration of IATI data into partner country aid systems and processes.</span></p><h3><b>We all have a role to play</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These objectives are ambitious and IATI\u2019s entire community has an important role to play in delivery them. Clear roles and responsibilities are defined in the strategy to help coordinate efforts and mobilise action across IATI\u2019s Secretariat, membership and TAG community (see page 4-6).</span></p><h3><b>Key building blocks \u2013 a new fund and taskforce</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure that our initiative can achieve joint action, the strategy rests on two key building blocks. The first is the Data Use Task Force, our new working group representing the diverse needs of IATI\u2019s membership, which will take the lead in driving the implementation and monitoring of action. The second is establishing a new Data Use Fund that will allow experts to bid for funds and deliver specific pieces of work aimed at overcoming identified barriers or solve real-world problems experienced by data users. </span></p><h3><b>What does success look like?</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our final strategy includes a detailed framework to monitor the results of our efforts (Annex I). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be reviewed periodically by the Data Use Task Force (supported by the Secretariat) and an internal evaluation will be carried out after two years.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a priority, the Data Use Task Force will develop a small number of milestones that are linked to the results framework, that can be achieved by August 2019, which marks the end of IATI\u2019s current hosting arrangements. </span></p><h3><b>Next steps\u2026</b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that IATI\u2019s Data Use Strategy has been approved, the Task Force will be meeting in early January to work on updating the data use elements of the draft budget and workplan (that was presented at the Members\u2019 Assembly). This will then be added to IATI\u2019s overall Y5 budget and workplan for the approval of IATI\u2019s Governing Board and members.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I look forward to providing further updates as our work progresses and I encourage you to read the strategy and find out how your organisation can play its role in increasing the use of IATI data.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Download the final </span><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oh_tFfe5sahfkeUISRynR2U6dm4lPQSS/view?usp=sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI Data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Strategy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or for more information contact the Secretariat at </span><a href=\"mailto:info@iatistandard.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@iatistandard.org</span></a></p>",

I\u2019d like to invite all IATI members to <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/tossd-task-force.htm\">follow the work of the TOSSD Task Force</a> as we develop the framework, ensure its usefulness for developing countries and undertake consultation in 2018. </p><div class=\"perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-right pullquote-border-placement-left\"><blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #bac200;\">\u201cFrom my time as Director-General at Sida, I know first-hand how vital the work of IATI is in enabling aid actors to be accountable both to those who fund them and those who they work for\u201d</span></p></blockquote></div><p>We\u2019re also modernising the definition of ODA (official development assistance) to bring it up to date with changes in the external environment. There will be a revised method for recording loans to the official sector and clarification of both the eligibility of peace and security efforts and the rules on reporting refugee costs in the donor country. We\u2019ve also worked to improve reporting on the role of private sector instruments (PSI), acknowledging them as part of ODA and increasing transparency on these flows.</p><p>Later this month we will launch this year\u2019s Development Cooperation Report, with data showing all our members\u2019 ODA. This year we focus on Data for Development. As you in IATI know well, decision makers understand the value of data but often that data is of poor quality, too complex or hidden in separate systems. We need data to follow up on aid commitments and to be able to see if development cooperation leads to results for people in partner countries.</p><p>However, DAC members do not invest enough in statistical capacity development in partner countries. We need to analyse and communicate all kinds of data better so that it can be used, building alliances between the data and statistics community on the one hand and the advocates and communicators on the other hand.</p><p>So, while we should celebrate progress on transparency, it is crucial that the OECD and IATI Secretariats engage in constant and constructive dialogue to make it as clear and easy as possible for member countries to publish to IATI and report to CRS, and to support efforts to use this data.</p>",

We operate in over 70 countries around the globe and celebrated our 80</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> birthday this year by launching our new five year strategy \u2013 </span><a href=\"https://plan-international.org/organisation/strategy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 Million Reasons</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><b>How did Plan International find out about IATI?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five of our national offices \u2013 Plan International Finland, UK, Ireland, Nederland, and USA have worked with IATI, having published data on the </span><a href=\"https://www.iatiregistry.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI Registry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Everyone in the development sector sees IATI as the gold standard on transparency.</span></p><p><b>Why have you decided to become a member? </b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transparency is a trend which we expect will be a major factor in our continued success as an organisation. My ultimate goal would be that Plan International becomes a transparency leader in our sector by becoming an organisation that is happy to share (and indeed shout about) our successes and failures, cost structures, research and data in real time. Everything for all to see. No filters, no \u2018for internal eyes only\u2019.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining IATI will lead to a standardised way of measuring the material impact on the lives of girls that Plan\u2019s interventions and campaigns has. Using the IATI Standard provides the basis for a standardised approach to this and will help us going forward working with our Country Offices on data collection and management. Ultimately this will lead to more effective interventions and provide us with authoritative data to inform our campaigns.</span></p><p><b>Why is transparency important to Civil Society Organisations?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see a shift to greater transparency in our sector not as an add-on that will bring about a number of benefits, but a necessity for our survival. Gone are the days of people taking information at face value. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citizens, and especially young people, challenge their political representatives on all levels. Patients challenge doctors on opinions and treatment options. Donors challenge charities on where their money goes and what impact it really has. For me, this level of challenge and empowerment is a great thing, but we need to respond to it in the right way. True transparency has to be simple and understandable to all audiences.</span></p><p><b>What information will you publish?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI gives us a way to communicate the most critical elements of our work in a format that can be consumed by many different public data users while helping to alleviate the need to produce multiple reports at different times of the year and for a wide range of individual stakeholders. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once fully implemented, our IATI releases and those of other publishers will allow us to link our results and expenditure to those of our donors and implementing partners. We want to continue to increase the involvement of the girls we are working to empower, therefore a user-friendly data portal with access to all of our data and an additional avenue for civic engagement is key to bringing our strategy to life.</span></p><p><b>Who do you think will benefit from your data?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we\u2019re producing data just for the sake of it, we\u2019re wasting everybody\u2019s time. I\u2019d like our information to benefit the children we represent, the individual and institutional donors who fund our work, our peers in our sector and ourselves.</span></p><p><b>Plan International are attending IATI\u2019s Members\u2019 Assembly in Rome next week. Are you looking forward to it?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely! We\u2019re expecting to learn a lot from attending our first Members\u2019 Assembly, and look forward to discussions with other members on transparency best practice and lessons learned.</span></p><p><b>How else would you like to be involved in the initiative? </b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are excited about doing our part and are happy to be joining a growing list of member organisations that are putting transparency at the very core of our work, working to improve IATI as a standard and revolutionising the way we communicate across offices and with our partners.</span></p>",

When they do, it can take a long time to fix. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tools are also difficult to adapt to the changing needs of our users.

The code for our 15+ tools and services is written in at least six languages to a variety of coding practices. This makes it hard to accomplish general maintenance efficiently.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of section 3A (Technical infrastructure) of the </span><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IATI-Workplan-updated-Dec-2016.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI workplan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019re creating pyIATI to provide a library of robust code, written to industry standards of best practice, as this is needed to create and better maintain new IATI tools. </span></p><p><b><i>Who is pyIATI for? </i></b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pyIATI acts as a software toolkit for both IATI\u2019s technical team developers and external developers in the IATI community.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put simply, the purpose of creating pyIATI is to provide reusable components to build IATI tools.

Together we manage the menagerie of <a href=\"https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-systems-design-architecture-proposal/709\">IATI tech</a> \u2013 a mix of codebases using varied languages and software design patterns</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The increase in our development and maintenance capacity over the past year is thanks to <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/members-assembly\">IATI\u2019s Members\u2019 Assembly</a> approving an uplift in budget, enabling us to bring new people into the team.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a recent addition to the IATI Tech Team, I\u2019ve been spending the last couple of months finding my feet. In the process, I thought it would be good to share some insights about how we work with the wider IATI community.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here is a casual breakdown of our working week. Enjoy!</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday is our dedicated bug and maintenance\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">day. Of course, if a major emergency crops up we\u2019ll get it sorted on any day of the week but most Monday projects are small irksome things rather than big hefty problems. We\u2019ve earmarked one particular day for these projects because, as any software developer knows, maintenance is an ongoing process that needs specific time allocated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially true for IATI which suffers from a pretty complex code base. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The code for our 10+ tools and services is written in at least six languages to a variety of coding practices</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fun times\u2026</span></p><p style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal;\"><a href=\"https://xkcd.com/license.html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5287 alignright\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/future_self_2x-1-1.png\" width=\"355\"/></a></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delving into the IATI code base is a lot like a C.S. Lewis book. You lose a sock, check your wardrobe for it, and end up in Narnia. You spend many days wandering about, surprised at all the strange creatures you stumble across and, when you leave, hardly anything of any particular relevance will have changed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sort of p</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">roblem is pretty ubiquitous when it comes to most code bases of a certain age. The typical circumstances are generally hard to avoid:</span></p><ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A series of pragmatic decisions </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">where the need to prove the initial concept comes before there is a real need to think about scalability and long-term maintenance</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The need to respond quickly to early user needs leaves limited time for improving code.</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These sorts of things </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leave us with software that is functional and demonstrates early user value but ultimately requires significant effort to keep working over the long term.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A perpetual victim of what we in the business call \u2018software rot\u2019.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allocating specific time for regular maintenance keeps us on top of high priority issues while allowing us to move forward without spending 15 years fighting for Aslan against the White Witch.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday-Thursday</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days are our main product development days. At the moment this is mostly taken up by creating IATI\u2019s new python library </span><a href=\"https://github.com/IATI/iati.core\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pyIATI</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (pronounced pie-at-ee!).</span></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/IATI/iati.core\"><strong>pyIATI \u2013 a developers\u2019 tool kit for IATI</strong></a><b> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aims to consolidate duplicated efforts across the IATI code base, create a central point of reference for all our IATI tools, and reduce the maintenance cost of the code base. It\u2019s basically magic.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning from lessons of the past and doing what we can to adhere to best practices means the processes we are using for pyIATI put </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quality, stability and longevity</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means:</span></p><ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building features based on User Stories</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robust testing</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular code reviews</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication and knowledge sharing</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequent refactoring (restructuring code to improve non-functional aspects)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clear documentation added as we go</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research and evaluation of processes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iterating over assumptions and design</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this takes more time up front but will be a huge time-saver in the long run.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To switch to construction metaphors, think of it like carpentry. It may take longer initially to measure up your plank at least twice, but you\u2019re saving a lot of time and money later when you only need to cut it once. The alternative being messing it up, running out of materials, and having to go back to the store to spend yet more time and money buying replacements.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Except, in our case, you\u2019ll only need to fetch your data once, or convert to CSV once for example. Right now, those tasks are happening at least three times a piece which significantly increases maintenance effort when bugs crop up.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also a question of foundations. The initial foundations of IATI were </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">based on prototypes and so require significant effort to keep running</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Things built on these foundations are fighting a losing battle and will eventually be swallowed up by encroaching entropy like a slowly sinking house. For example, we would like to add new features and improved functionality to the Dashboard and Datastore, but just keeping up with existing reported issues for these tools already takes up too many of our resources.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pyIATI is a big effort to underpin the foundations and shore everything up now, before we end up with serious subsidence problems later. In the case of IATI, pyIATI means it will be easier to extend existing tool functionality, create new shiny end-user tools, and fix problems with existing ones. We don\u2019t want an unmanageable swamp of bugs swallowing up our ability to incorporate new user requirements.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end of the week offers a chance to tidy up loose ends from our main product development days, as well as manage relationships with external suppliers, engage with the community, and reflect on our workflow to improve our own processes.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that\u2019s what our working week looks like right now. We\u2019re on track to start using pyIATI for the project to build a new IATI website in the coming weeks. This will be a great way to test its real-world functionality and identify areas for improvement in order to streamline future projects. #TheJoysOfSoftware</span></p>",

Whether it\u2019s a charity in the UK, a company in Malaysia, or a government department in Canada, the ability to describe these different entities in a consistent way is key to opening and linking up data about their activities.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This collaboration of data standard bodies has agreed to provide and maintain a shared register of the lists where organisation identifiers are found at org-id.guide (replacing and updating the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/\">Organisation Registration Agency </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">codelis</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t). The project builds on the methodology developed by IATI of presenting identifiers in two parts \u2013 a list code, and the identifier drawn from that list. \u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International Women\u2019s Development Agency organisation identifier</span></i></span><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5054 aligncenter\" height=\"126\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.png\" style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: 300;\" width=\"215\"/></p><h3><b><i>Background: why do we need organisation identifiers?</i></b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be many organisations in the same country with the same name; an organisation might change its name; or the name may be written in different ways in different places. However, no two organisations should have the same number or identifier in an official list, and their number generally doesn\u2019t change. Using this identifier alongside an organisation name makes sure data clearly references the right organisation, and so links can be made across datasets that refer to the same organisation. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is still possible that two different lists might include the same number \u2013 but for different organisations. That\u2019s why org-id.guide provides codes for each identifier list. Combining these with the identifiers gives globally unique and unambiguous ways to reference an organisation. \u00a0</span></p><h3><b><i>How does org-id.guide help?</i></b></h3><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5062 alignright\" height=\"347\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.guide-2-2.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.guide-2-2.png 887w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.guide-2-2-450x398.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.guide-2-2-768x680.png 768w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/org-id.guide-2-2-600x531.png 600w\" style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: 300;\" width=\"391\"/></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Us</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ers can easily search by </span><b>country, type of organisation and sector</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through org-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">id.guide\u2019s directory of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">official registration agencies and third party lists to help find organisation identifiers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the search criteria, org-id.guide provides the lists that are most likely to have the organisation identifier you are looking for.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even better, org-id.guide ranks the results according to the reliability of the identifiers, the availability of public search, and the provision of open data for the lists:</span></p><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5068\" height=\"336\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Suggested-Lists.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Suggested-Lists.png 602w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Suggested-Lists-450x251.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Suggested-Lists-600x335.png 600w\" width=\"602\"/></p><h3><b><i>Who is org-id.guide for?</i></b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Org-id.guide is particularly helpful to:</span></p><ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">organisations publishing open data for the first time who need to find their own organisation identifier</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">publishers naming other organisations in their data to ensure it is more accurate and more machine-searchable</span></li>\n</ul><h3><b><i>What if there\u2019s no list that can help me?</i></b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just let us know by posting a request </span><a href=\"http://docs.org-id.guide\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as described in our contributors\u2019 handbook</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and we\u2019ll research potential lists that might contain the identifiers you need.</span></p><h3><b><i>What difference will org-id.guide make?</i></b></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope that org-id-guide will improve interoperability between datasets. By organisations being described with consistent organisation identifiers in open datasets, this will help data users link up information about organisations\u2019 activities.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many advantages to joining up data about organisations. For example, it takes us one step closer to traceability and an ability to follow the money, as there is tremendous demand to trace funding throughout long and complex international development delivery chains from the origin to the point of delivery. It can help link contracting records with information on the beneficial ownership of firms. Or it can support analysis of the extent to which government procurement is encouraging cross-border trade or not, by increasing clarity about where firms are registered and how they are controlled.</span></p><h3><em><b>What are your future plans?</b></em></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We want to carry out more proactive research so that org-id.guide includes every company register, charity register, and government identifier list in the world.

        "content": "<p><em>Guest blog from\u00a0James Coe (Publish What You Fund), Annelise Parr (IATI Secretariat &amp; UNDP) and Reid Porter (InterAction).</em></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last month, Ghana hosted the second </span><a href=\"http://africaopendata.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Africa Open Data Conference</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (AODC). The event sought to showcase the thriving open data community on the continent, bringing together open data advocates, journalists, sector specialists and software developers from across Africa and beyond.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Representatives from the </span><a href=\"https://www.interaction.org/project/open-ag-funding/overview\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initiative for Open Ag Funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (IATI) Secretariat were both in attendance. While we had different reasons for taking part in the conference, we had a common cause \u2013 to demonstrate IATI data, promote its use and listen to suggestions on how to make it more useful. Below are our top five takeaways:</span></p><h2>1. There\u2019s no shortage of impassioned pleas for data</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the IATI community often laments the lack of apparent data users, we found the very opposite at AODC. There was no shortage of impassioned pleas for information on development spending, and once people became aware of IATI, they were hungry for more. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More often than not, individuals had very specific information needs, wanting to look in detail at one or two specific donors or projects to understand their objectives, commitments, disbursements and impact. They also wanted to know the process of validation to understand how reliable the data was. Attendees did recognise, however, that introducing more layers of validation would delay early access to key information with which they could hold officials to account. Nevertheless, the users are there, and they want more data.</span></p><h2>2. We need to refocus our efforts towards in-country users</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greater attention needs to be paid to engaging with the recipient country civil society users, as well as their governments. Our demonstrations of </span><a href=\"http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI\u2019s search tool, d-portal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were met with enthusiasm and interest. However, we found that requests for support would quickly outpace our ability to deliver it. Our takeaway from this was the \u00a0significant need for more focused in-country work promoting ways to use and share IATI data.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, we should be clear about who the target users for IATI data are. Some of the people we met, such as journalists and government transparency advocates, were clearly interested in being direct consumers of this data, but many end users will benefit from IATI only indirectly. In other words, the IATI intermediaries \u2013 developers, data quality advocates, transparency nerds \u2013 need to ensure that we\u2019re providing data that is useful for national and local governments, local CSOs, and the general public, via formats and tools that they can readily use and access.</span></p><h2>3. Good, comprehensive data is not enough</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need tools to more effectively access and query the data. One significant challenge for IATI is the difficulty in using the data. We found that simply sharing the links to available tools was not enough, as people were unable to understand what they were looking at, its context or how to use it. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further investment in data visualisations and simple query tools are vital if people are to start using the data. Without this, progress will only be made through one-to-one training which, while important, is not a sustainable way towards ensuring that data is used to improve development effectiveness. With such an engaged IATI community already familiar with the data, creating these kinds of tools is possible and would result in significant benefits for different user groups.</span></p><h2>4. We have to acknowledge that IATI is just one piece of the puzzle</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Development data is only one piece of a broader \u2018data-ecosystem\u2019 and is often needed alongside other data to enable proper analysis. There is much that the producers and intermediaries of this data can do to ensure that it is fit for purpose and accessible to intended users, but we should not forget that local data brokers -innovation hubs, tech companies, data scientists, incubators \u2013 can play a significant role in adding value and context to IATI data flows and repurposing it for local use and consumption. One example heard by the Initiative for Open Ag Funding was that aid investment flows by crop type juxtaposed with crop type yield by location would enable significantly more in-depth analysis.</span></p><h2>5. IATI is more than data, it\u2019s also a library</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most attractive aspects of the IATI Standard is that publishers can link to project documents. The list of documents available often includes country strategies, budgets, \u00a0project evaluations and even business and procurement documents. We found that users wanted the ability to peruse project documents as part of their investigations and research and, thus, we shouldn\u2019t assume that \u2018data is the only way\u2019. With this, we should continue to push publishers to share not just the data but all the accompanying documentation so that IATI can serve as a useful library, as well as a data repository. </span></p><p>\u00a0</p>",

The most recent update to the standard to version 2.02 also includes the ability to publish results and needs assessments and to tag activities to specific SDGs. These upgrades to the standard together with sustained outreach activities by UNDP in its role as coordinator of the IATI Secretariat have also led to an increase in membership numbers in IATI from 66 to 75 members, including four additional UN agencies (UNIDO, UNEP, FAO and WHO). See IATI website for more.\u00a0</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>While acknowledging progress in completeness and timeliness of data from development partners on development cooperation, the latest DCF Accountability Study calls for greater attention and efforts to address the persisting challenges facing developing countries, including uneven accessibility of development cooperation information systems for different stakeholders; difficulties in collecting quality data through existing development cooperation information systems; and lack of financial resources to develop and strengthen development cooperation information systems.\u00a0</em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://developmentfinance.un.org/transparency-and-needs-assessment\"><strong>Data, monitoring and Follow-up: Transparency and needs assessment</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"views-field views-field-field-section-intro\">\n<p class=\"field-content\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>There has been a strong surge in the total number of organisations publishing data to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standard. The total now stands at over 500, an increase by more than one third from 350 in late 2015. During the same period, publishers have significantly expanded the volume of activities they publish, with spending of US$146 billion reported to IATI in 2016, rising from US$78 billion in 2015. Timeliness of reporting has improved, with 96 per cent of the data (US$140 billion) reported by publishers updating their data at least every quarter \u2013 increasing from 80 per cent in 2015; 48 per cent of data is provided by publishers updating their data at least every month \u00a0\u2013 rising from 41 per cent in 2015.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p class=\"field-content\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Donors have significantly increased the amount of forward-looking budget data they publish. In late 2015 published forward-looking data on planned international development cooperation expenditure rose to US$126 billion for 2017 and 2018. These improvements by publishers are helping to meet partner country requests for more timely and forward-looking data and making the data more valuable for a broad range of stakeholders. Different means of accessing and using IATI data are becoming available at country level, with systems providers beginning to include modules for importing IATI data directly into national Aid Information Management Systems. As the volume of good quality reliable data increases, partner country members of IATI such as Bangladesh, Liberia, Madagascar, Myanmar and others are now able to use the data to inform reporting and budgeting. National representatives also use it to learn more about projects reported in their constituencies not just by bilateral and multilateral donors, but also by international and national NGOs, foundations and increasingly \u2013 private sector organisations.</em></p>\n</div>",

The indicator helps describe an outcome, for example the number of pregnant women receiving antenatal care. </span></p><p><em><b>Why is it important to display results in d-portal?</b></em><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI\u2019s online search platform </span><a href=\"http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=search\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d-portal</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows anyone in the world with internet access to view data published by over 500 development and humanitarian organisations. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By including results data, we\u2019re helping users to discover the difference, or impact, that development cooperation and humanitarian assistance has made.

        "content": "<p><em>This blog was written for the <a href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/about/\">Open Contracting Partnership</a>\u00a0by Steven Flower at <a href=\"http://www.opendataservices.coop/\">Open Data Services Co-operative</a>\u00a0and re-posted from open-contracting.org\u00a0</em></p><p>Global foreign aid is a $100-billion-dollar-affair. But how much of the money I contribute as a taxpayer arrives on the ground to deliver vital goods and services to people in need? Answering this question proves difficult.</p><p>To get a clear picture of the aims and objectives of aid programs, where activities are being delivered, and how they are financed, we require information that\u2019s often trapped in multiple organisational silos.</p><p>At IATI\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/technicaladvisorygroup/tag-meetings/tag-meeting-2017\">Technical Advisory Group</a> meeting in Dar es Salaam, we set out to discuss how we can connect information on aid flows and contracts by joining up data published using two different data standards.</p><p>We have explored this relationship in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDDSBYCt-FPI2jV1d226j9GBkQVCTIHkQtZk42PoBBU/edit?usp=sharing\">more detail</a>, but here\u2019s a summary.</p><p>First, we identified the core focus of each standard:</p><ul>\n<li>The IATI standard starts from an \u2018aid activity\u2019, which may relate to a large-scale program involving many partners or a simple project delivered on the ground in a particular locality. Aid activities can be linked together in a delivery chain where, for example, a program funds a countrywide project, which then funds a local project.IATI captures classifications of the aid, location data, information about partners, and details of incoming and outgoing transactions for each activity.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/about/\">Open Contracting Data Standard</a> (OCDS) starts from the \u201ccontracting process\u201d and captures information on each stage, from planning, through tender, to award, contract and implementation.In general, each OCDS record relates to a single tender but may incorporate multiple awards and contracts signed, and implemented, as a result of one initial solicitation.</li>\n</ul><p>These standards also differ on a technical level. The IATI standard uses an XML data model, whereas the OCDS uses JSON as its primary schema language.</p><p>Once the focus of each standard was evident, we explored how they related to each other. We discussed three models at the Dar es Salaam meeting.</p><ul>\n<li><b>When an aid activity and contracting process are essentially the same thing </b>\u2013 for example, when a government plans an aid project and contracts a single supplier to deliver it.<b><br/>\n</b></li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><strong>When an aid activity leads to one or more contracting process(es)</strong> \u2013 for example, when a program is planned and tenders run to find a number of suppliers who will be involved in delivering the program.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><strong>When a contracting process leads to one or more aid activities</strong> \u2013 for example, a tender is issued to solicit ideas for new aid programs and once the ideas are collected, a budget is allocated and aid activities started.</li>\n</ul><p>The relationship can vary from case-to-case and country-to-country depending on the administrative processes, so any integration between the standards needs to take these different models into account.</p><p>During the third step we dived into the technical approaches to the integration. In our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDDSBYCt-FPI2jV1d226j9GBkQVCTIHkQtZk42PoBBU/edit#\">working paper</a>, we outline the use of <b>identifier cross-references</b> and <b>document links</b> to establish clear connections between contracting and aid.</p><p>This would require only minor updates to the two standards, such as adding relevant codelist entries. Current implementers of the OCDS and IATI standard should be able to add these to their publication processes relatively easily.</p><p>Fortunately this is already happening. In our workshop, we heard that donors such as the UK Department for International Development and Global Affairs Canada have started to make these links. We will now explore the different approaches in more detail and seek partners and case studies. Have you worked on either? Let us know! We\u2019d love to learn more.</p><p>Post your comments and suggestions on\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/2017/03/29/linking-aid-contracts/\">open-contracting.org</a>.</p>",

Here are seven ways I think we can keep moving forwards together:</span></p><h2>1. Champion IATI at country-level</h2><p>With almost 70% of our participants attending their first IATI meeting, the event was as much about introducing our initiative, as it was improving it with long-standing members.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was encouraging to hear that, after learning about accessing IATI data through </span><a href=\"http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d-portal.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, representatives from Sierra Leone were keen to use it to support their government\u2019s budget process and promote the initiative on an upcoming broadcast programme. This shows the power of IATI to engage a wide range of people in partner countries.</span></p><p><strong>Your challenge: champion IATI to your colleagues in developing countries, including within country donor offices.</strong></p><h2>2. Support IATI\u2019s inclusion in internal systems</h2><p>Developing countries also said they would benefit from technical support to integrate IATI data into their existing government processes and systems.</p><p>During our excellent lighting-talks, the Government of Liberia shared their progress on working with Mark Brough on using IATI data in their internal information management systems for better aid coordination.</p><p><strong>Your challenge: Work with government partners to help get IATI data into government systems.</strong></p><h2>3. Sell the benefits to IATI publishers</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI is still a young standard and many organisations are interested in being a part of it. During one session, we heard about the business case on publishing from </span><a href=\"http://akvo.org/blog/mapping-iati-a-business-case-framework/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Akvo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which clearly articulates the benefits for an organisation.</span></p><p><strong>Your challenge: Continue to communicate the advantages of IATI to people who you think could benefit from using the standard to share data.</strong></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IATI_aid\">@IATI_aid</a> data can be a foundation for M&amp;E, reporting and communication. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TAG2017?src=hash\">#TAG2017</a> says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mato74\">@mato74</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4YnqPh09BI\">pic.twitter.com/4YnqPh09BI</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Ntawiha Wilbrod (@wilbrodnk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wilbrodnk/status/839424045208719360\">March 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote><p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p><h2>4.

Evolve IATI\u2019s Standard</h2><p>I really enjoyed the session that we had on IATI 3.0+ where we discussed different aspects of the future of IATI. I\u2019ll write another blog post about that one day, but my sense was that we are keen to move IATI from a \u2018publishing\u2019 standard to a \u2018data interchange\u2019 standard and use it in a much wider range of situations to share data on our activities.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4435 alignright\" height=\"185\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/-27D68EDDB34A5D3ABFE76E50F38F90E575BB2B2D557A8CD2A2-pimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/-27D68EDDB34A5D3ABFE76E50F38F90E575BB2B2D557A8CD2A2-pimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg 1200w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/-27D68EDDB34A5D3ABFE76E50F38F90E575BB2B2D557A8CD2A2-pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/-27D68EDDB34A5D3ABFE76E50F38F90E575BB2B2D557A8CD2A2-pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/-27D68EDDB34A5D3ABFE76E50F38F90E575BB2B2D557A8CD2A2-pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/-27D68EDDB34A5D3ABFE76E50F38F90E575BB2B2D557A8CD2A2-pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-260x195.jpg 260w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/-27D68EDDB34A5D3ABFE76E50F38F90E575BB2B2D557A8CD2A2-pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-150x112.jpg 150w\" width=\"245\"/>The final day of the TAG was a formal Standards Day where we discussed a range of possible changes to the IATI Standard, leading up to the next decimal upgrade (v2.03) later in 2017, and an integer upgrade (v3.01) in 2018.This was a fast-moving (and fun!) day, and we were pleased to have made some key decisions to move the Standard forward.</p><p><strong>Your challenge: continue to contribute to the future evolution of the IATI Standard.</strong></p><h2>6.

It\u2019s essential that this valuable information is now used to improve the effectiveness of these resources through enhanced decision making, transparency and accountability. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why Development Initiatives has launched a new report \u2018<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/reaching-the-potential-a-review-of-iati-data-use-and-ways-to-increase-it/\">Reaching the potential of IATI</a>\u2019,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which we hope will add value to discussions at the TAG. Co-written by me and Conrad Zellman, we\u2019ve assessed how IATI data has been used since the standard was created in 2011, and what is needed from our community to ensure more people benefit from this initiative.</span></p><h2>Why use IATI data?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s vital that we are clear on the potential benefits that the data can bring to a wide range of actors: from developing country governments to citizens. Our review of available literature identified three key use cases:</span></p><ul>\n<li><b>Increasing transparency<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, through the application of a common and open reporting standard to enable access and use of comprehensive, comparable, timely and forward-looking data on financial resource flows.</span></b></li>\n<li><b>Increasing efficiency and effectiveness<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, through the use of IATI data in planning, coordinating and mobilising resources for better development interventions.</span></b></li>\n<li><b>Increasing accountability<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, through the use of IATI data by a range of official and non-official actors to monitor delivery, detect corruption and advocate for improvements. \u00a0</span></b></li>\n</ul><h2>Who\u2019s making the most use of IATI data now?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprisingly it\u2019s donors\u2026 IATI was originally established with the aim of meeting the demand from developing country governments for timely, comprehensive and forward-looking information on external resources.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However by far the most evident current use case for this data in practice is in information portals set up by donors and development partners. Due to their focus on (mostly) individual providers, these efforts primarily serve to demonstrate transparency and accountability to a domestic or international audience.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our report lists 12 such portals currently operating, spanning major bilateral aid providers as well as multilateral actors.</span></p><h2>Are developing countries using IATI?</h2><h5><strong><em>Local aid management systems</em></strong></h5><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the data for decision-making processes crucially depends on the level of integration of IATI with local AIMS (Aid Information Management Systems). In </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/BD-IATI-AIMS\">Bangladesh</a>,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/about/partner-country-perspectives/iatiundp-regional-workshop-on-data-usage-accra-ghana\">Rwanda</a>,\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/IATI-JuneSCMeetings-FINAL.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chad, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Madagascar, and Senegal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work has been undertaken to import IATI data into AIMS. </span></p><h5><em><strong>Full picture of resources </strong></em></h5><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some governments are regularly using IATI data to check and/or complement their own data. For example, in Liberia the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning </span><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/using-iati-data-60-second-interview-with-liberian-government\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported using IATI data</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to monitor flow of external resources in the context of the Ebola crisis.</span></p><h5><em><strong>Accountability</strong></em></h5><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evidence for use of IATI-based information to hold development resource providers and implementers to account is perhaps most limited to date. An example of this use case involved efforts to monitor implementation of DFID-funded NGO projects by the </span><a href=\"http://integrityaction.org/sites/default/files/publication/files/Publication_NTA%20Integrity%20Action%20Aid%20Transaprency%20Pilot%20Project.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Taxpayers Association together with Integrity Action</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Kenya.</span></p><h2>What does our community need to work on?</h2><ul>\n<li><b><i>Raising awareness at national level</i> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Busy government officials may not be aware that IATI even exists and we need greater efforts to promote the initiative. From the review, donor country offices of leading IATI publishers indicated an urgent need to raise awareness.</span></li>\n<li><b><i>Supporting integration with in-country aid management systems</i></b> \u2013\u00a0We need to work together to ensure more countries implement the automatic import of IATI data into their AIMS. For this to be sustainable, there needs to be ownership by developing country governments, as observed in Myanmar\u2019s <a href=\"https://mohinga.info/en/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mohinga</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Bangladesh\u2019s own home-grown AIMS.</span></li>\n<li><b><i>Evidence of value added</i> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013</span> <b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To encourage more use, we need a clear evidence base on how IATI data adds value to government systems and their decision making processes.</span></i></b></li>\n<li><b><i>New solutions and tools for different users needs</i></b> \u2013 <b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we need</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more in-depth research on what </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specific problems</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> IATI can solve. This will contribute to developing appropriate support as well as technical and analytical tools.</span></i></b></li>\n<li><b>Overcoming key technical obstacles</b> \u2013\u00a0Existing IATI tools need to be improved, in particular making the Datastore more user-friendly. Improvements to data quality and the Standard through better publication of data by organisations such as accurate sub-locations, local language descriptions, use or related field to enable traceability of funds, etc.</li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve the above, we need more investment, as well as political will, from many key stakeholders including developing country governments, donors and other non-state actors. Being at TAG 2017 has filled me with confidence that the IATI community is ready to meet these challenges. </span></p>",

However the report says there are still \u201ctoo many organisations which either do not publish or need to improve the quality of their data\u201d. DFID will continue to improve the quality of its own IATI data, as well as expecting other UK departments to do the same.</p><p>DFID already requires its implementing partners to publish to IATI and this review sets out the vision of achieving traceability throughout the system \u201cso that anyone, anywhere can trace funding, all the way from the taxpayer to the beneficiary\u201d. The reports says DFID will announce detailed plans for this in due course.</p><p><strong>Raising the Standard: the Multilateral Development Review 2016</strong></p><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/573884/Multilateral-Development-Review-Dec2016.pdf\">Multilateral Development Review 2016</a>, organisations\u2019 commitment to global aid transparency standards forms part of DFID\u2019s assessment methodology. The report states that agencies are taking transparency more seriously, \u201cwith much more data now published in an accessible way, based on the standards of IATI\u201d. DFID praised <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/secretariat\">IATI Secretariat member, UNDP\u2019s</a> record saying they \u201chave gone beyond the basic requirements and are demonstrating a culture of transparency across their operation\u201d.</p><p>The multilateral development review sets out DFID\u2019s expectation for all its multilateral partners to \u201cmeet IATI standards as a minimum\u201d. Most agencies in the review are already IATI publishers, with three more committing to IATI by the end of 2016. The\u00a0review however states that 10\u00a0agencies remain uncommitted.</p><p>DFID also says it will drive the implementation of the World Humanitarian Summit Grand Bargain agreement on reforming the humanitarian system. This included a <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/publish-to-iati-within-2-years-of-the-whs-says-grand-bargain-on-humanitarian-financing\">commitment by global actors</a> to publish their humanitarian financing to IATI within two years.</p><p>Read full reports: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/573889/Bilateral-Development-Review-2016.pdf\">Rising to the challenge of ending poverty: the Bilateral Development Review 2016</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/573884/Multilateral-Development-Review-Dec2016.pdf\">Raising the Standard: the Multilateral Development Review 2016</a>.</p>",

At the previous HLM in 2014, IATI agreed a new Global Partnership Initiative (<a href=\"http://effectivecooperation.org/monitoring-country-progress/global-partnership-initiatives/\">GPI</a>) that was annexed to the Mexico Communiqu\u00e9. This committed IATI members to accelerate their efforts to meet the Busan transparency commitment as well as working together to promote greater use of IATI data.</p><h4><strong><span style=\"color: #b8c400;\">What has IATI achieved?</span></strong></h4><p><img alt=\"497-publishers\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4276 aligncenter\" height=\"720\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/497-publishers-.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/497-publishers-.png 960w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/497-publishers--450x338.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/497-publishers--768x576.png 768w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/497-publishers--600x450.png 600w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/497-publishers--260x195.png 260w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/497-publishers--150x112.png 150w\" width=\"960\"/></p><ul>\n<li><strong>Publishers</strong><strong>:</strong> Since the Busan Partnership Agreement in 2011, the number of organisations publishing IATI data has <em><u>jumped from a mere </u></em><strong><em><u>17 </u></em></strong><em><u>to almost </u></em><strong><em><u>500 </u></em></strong><em><u>today</u></em>.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><strong>Membership</strong>: IATI is a truly multi-stakeholder initiative, growing to over <strong>70 </strong><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/members-assembly\">members</a><br/>\nfrom across the world, including donor and partner country governments, multilaterals, foundations, private sector and CSOs.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><strong>Data quality</strong>: We continue to see steady improvements in the quality of the data from IATI publishers, ensuring that their information is useful.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><strong>Data use</strong><strong><em>:</em></strong> The value of IATI data is being increasingly recognised.

        "content": "<p><em>This blog was written by Andrew Clarke at the Omidyar Network and reposted from www.omidyar.com.</em></p><p style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">Transparency is a central theme in the work of <a href=\"https://www.omidyar.com\">Omidyar Network</a> and its investees and a major goal of our <a href=\"https://www.omidyar.com/initiatives/governance-citizen-engagement\">Governance &amp; Citizen Engagement initiative</a>. It is only right that we set an example by sharing good quality, timely and open data on our activities. So we have decided to increase our transparency by providing a comprehensive dataset on our grant portfolio, in line with international best practice, namely the International Aid Transparency Initiative\u00a0(IATI).</p><p style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\"><strong><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Why this matters</span></strong></p><ul style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">\n<li style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">Development finance is hard to track, especially, but not only in developing countries. And keeping abreast of the myriad initiatives and projects in the spaces that we operate can be a challenge! It\u2019s worth considering a few different users of information and the challenges they face.</li>\n<li style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"color: #b8c400;\">Civil servants often don\u2019t have accurate information on international investments in their countries.</span> For example, Ghanaian education ministry officials are often in the dark about foreign investments in the education sector, undermining their ability to plan Ghana\u2019s education budget effectively, learn about different models, and identify relative capital gaps.</li>\n<li style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"color: #b8c400;\">International development funders similarly lack good data on current activities.</span> While we may know well the work of our closest peers, the multiplicity of funders in many sectors can lead to duplication, under-funded sectors and geographies, and high transaction costs on partners.</li>\n<li style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"color: #b8c400;\">Journalists and researchers want good quality, comparable data</span> on development activities to gain insights, identify trends, and influence future interventions.</li>\n<li style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"color: #b8c400;\">Grantees and their partners often struggle</span> to get reliable information about work happening in parallel sectors and other countries. By providing data that complies with common classifications, we can make it easier for them to discover and learn from other initiatives.</li>\n</ul><p style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">Transparency of funding is a work in progress: all actors will have to contribute to achieve a full picture. But by providing information in line with our bilateral, multilateral, and philanthropic peers, Omidyar Network will be helping to strengthen country systems, support better decision-making by the global funding network, and will make us and our peers more effective grant makers through increased peer\u00a0learning.</p><p style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\"><strong><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\">How we\u2019re addressing this</span></strong></p><p style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">As of November 2016, we will be disclosing, on a quarterly basis, data on our nonprofit portfolio, in a structured data format that complies with the IATI standard, now used by the majority of international development funders. You can read our <a href=\"https://www.omidyar.com/values-policies\" style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">IATI policy</a> to understand our approach in detail. This is a work in progress \u2013 we will continue to increase the quality and depth of our data on our grant-making and welcome\u00a0feedback.</p>",

UK CSOs are leading the world on progress in transparency. However, the quality and completeness of the material published varies. This can result in data that is difficult to use and reduce the transparency of the overall flow of aid. The challenge now is to ensure that transparency data is actually used to improve development effectiveness. DFID will make it a key requirement to enhance the quality and use of data. At a minimum, by the end of 2017, centrally funded CSOs will be required to meet the full International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard on all their funding, and ensure that all the organisations in their delivery chain also meet the standard. DFID will continually review its transparency requirements, with a view to expanding and enhancing them in the coming months and years. DFID will work collaboratively with both Bond and other donor governments to explore the possibility of reducing DFID reporting requirements where CSOs proactively publish their data through IATI. </span></i></p>",

It brings together key organisations driving standards for open data across a range of sectors including contracting, extractives, international aid, agriculture and philanthropy. A challenge shared by all these initiatives is how to accurately and consistently identify an organisation. Whether it\u2019s a charity in the UK, a company in Malaysia, or a government department in Canada, the ability to describe these different entities in a consistent way is key to opening and linking up data about their activities, ensuring it is accessible and useful.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initiative will establish an open interface so that anyone can find known organisation registries; it will also embark on a research process to highlight others.

In turn, this will provide a foundation for the open data community to both share and use identifiers about organisations, using this common protocol. \u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) kick-started this work in 2012.

        "content": "<p><em>This post is written by Martin Akerman at the United Nations Population Fund.</em></p><p>Reporting on complex delivery chains and being able to track funds from one organisation to another is central to improving development cooperation effectiveness.</p><p>UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, is working with a consortium of donor countries and development agencies, led by the Netherlands, on a new traceability pilot. At the <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/members-assembly/annual-members-assembly-meeting\">2016 IATI Members Assembly</a>, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, the United States, Belgium, Finland, Publish What You Fund, UNFPA, UNICEF, and the African Development Bank met to establish how to use IATI data to increase the traceability of activities through multilateral organisations.</p><p>UNFPA joined IATI and has been publishing data on activities to its <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/\">Standard</a> since 2012. Launched in 2008, IATI enables the publication of machine-readable, timely, comprehensive and forward-looking development information in a common, open format. The rapid increase in IATI publishers (today at nearly 500) has allowed data users to access a growing share of the world\u2019s development cooperation activities via IATI\u2019s online <a href=\"http://www.iatiregistry.org/\">Registry</a> and <a href=\"http://datastore.iatistandard.org/docs/\">Datastore</a>. IATI\u2019s Standard has also evolved to accommodate a wider range of data user\u2019s needs. These include the <strong>automated use of IATI data </strong>to populate key information and decision-making systems; the<strong> reporting of humanitarian assistance</strong> during emergencies; and <strong>harmonisation of data from all publishers</strong> to common frameworks such as the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm\">OECD-DAC</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.org/icpd\">International Conference on Population and Development</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.org/sdg\">Sustainable Development Goals</a> among <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/SectorVocabulary/\">others</a>.</p><p>IATI has empowered many development actors and data aggregators to establish open data portals\u00a0(for example Sweden\u2019s <a href=\"http://openaid.se/aid/2015/\">Openaid.se</a> and the Netherland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.openaid.nl/\">OpenNL</a>). These are built on the IATI Standard and linked to the IATI Registry to streamline information collection, reduce traditional manual data entry, and allow for more efficient coordination of development activities over time. In a growing number of cases, these portals have become the norm for reporting and communicating development activities and their outcomes within ministries, parliaments and congressional bodies. The need for machine-readable data from implementing partners \u2013 including multilateral organisations and pooled funding vehicles \u2013 has become one of the most significant hurdles donors face as they look to streamline information sharing and reduce manual data entry.</p><p>The Netherlands has been leading automated traceability efforts of their financing through IATI with a <a href=\"https://www.drostan.org/2016/06/iati-traceability-in-the-health-systems-advocacy-partnership/?utm_campaign=coschedule&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=rolfkleef&amp;utm_content=IATI%20Traceability%20in%20the%20Health%20Systems%20Advocacy%20Partnership\">handful of NGOs</a> and introduced mandatory IATI publishing for most activities funded by the government this year. In May, they set sights on a seemingly more ambitious target and approached several UN agencies to come up with a strategy that would allow contributions to multi-donor funds, specifically core support to UN agencies, to be linked to development outcomes. Since launching their data portal in 2014, Sweden has also communicated several obstacles they face in having to manually enter data related to core contributions to multilateral organisations, <a href=\"http://openaid.se/aid/sweden/multilateral-core-support/united-nations-population-fund/all/2015/\">including UNFPA</a>.</p><p>In establishing this traceability pilot, we will seek to overcome these issues and aim to reduce the need for manual reporting. Working with the consortium, our goal is to eliminate ad-hoc reports over time and increase the flow of information from one agency to another automatically through IATI. Here are our three keys to success:</p><p><strong>The first</strong> is to establish how and in what specific marker one organisation will be referencing another.</p><p><img alt=\"traceability-2\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4190\" height=\"116\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/traceability-2.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/traceability-2.png 577w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/traceability-2-450x90.png 450w\" width=\"577\"/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>The second</strong> is to create a pool funding arm (activity) for each multilateral organisation that is able to reference the core contributions of bilateral donors.</p><p><img alt=\"unfpa-traceability\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4191\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/UNFPA-traceability-1.png\" width=\"417\"/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>The third and final</strong> is to make sure that all core and pool-funded activities and related results show a relationship to the established pool funding activity.</p><p><img alt=\"traceability-3\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4192\" height=\"337\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/traceability-3.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/traceability-3.png 576w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/traceability-3-450x263.png 450w\" width=\"576\"/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This multi-stakeholder pilot promises to streamline information collection, help avoid double-reporting, reduce traditional manual data entry and allow for more efficient coordination of development activities.

We are also demonstrating the importance we attach to IATI through our work to use its data. This work has been highly innovative and we hope Bangladesh can continue its role as an incubator of new and practical solutions. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[pullquote] Long ago, Bangladesh took the decision to develop our own AIMS rather than using an off-the-shelf solution.\u00a0[/pullquote]</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last year, supported by</span><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DFID</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and working with</span><a href=\"http://www.undp.org/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UNDP</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bangladesh has been working to develop a module to import IATI data into our home-grown AIMS.\u00a0Long ago, Bangladesh took the decision to develop our own AIMS rather than using an off-the-shelf solution.</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This gave us much more flexibility when we came to develop this new module, because we own all the source code and can work with local developers to improve and extend it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of these efforts, as presented at the last </span><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/members-assembly/annual-members-assembly-meeting\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI Members\u2019 Assembly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is innovative in three ways:</span></p><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #b8c43e;\"><b>It can scale quickly</b><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, as it is a general solution which can take data from many donors, rather than developing specific solutions for importing data from each one;</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #b8c43e;\"><strong>It avoids double-counting</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, as it allows and helps donors to identify projects reported to IATI that are also reported by another organisation;</span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #b8c43e;\"><b>It significantly reduces the workload and cost</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\"> of the country offices of donors (primarily responsible for feeding data to the AIMS) who are active in the country, while adding and updating project information.</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having done all this work to develop this module, the next steps are potentially much more exciting and could have significant positive implications for development in Bangladesh.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #232c3e;\">Firstly,</span> we should move donors to importing data from IATI rather than manually entering it to reduce the burden on both donors and the government. It will also free up resources to allow us to focus on obtaining data from other development partners. Critically, it will also allow us to move resources from data collection to analysis and distribution. That brings us to the next key step.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[pullquote]\u00a0we should begin to use IATI data to improve the way decisions are made.[/pullquote]</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #232c3e;\">Secondly, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we should begin to use IATI data to improve the way decisions are made. This should include outreach to donors, line ministries, sector working groups and civil society, including significant capacity building in using the data.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would help us develop a greater understanding of how IATI can contribute to improving the use and management of aid at country level. User interfaces would also be improved in response to user feedback, for example, to begin to capture and use results data, to monitor whether projects are meeting their intended objectives and to intervene where this is not the case. This could allow us and our partners to better target interventions and increase their impact.\u00a0</span></p><h2>[pullquote]This also has important implications for the SDG agenda, as better data should make it easier to track progress by the Government of Bangladesh, donors and civil society.[/pullquote]</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting up with other systems, particularly with budget systems is a key part of this work and something we have been exploring. This also has important implications for the SDG agenda, as better data should make it easier to track progress by the Government of Bangladesh, donors and civil society.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are in discussions with our partners in Bangladesh about how to move our work to this next promising stage and would welcome discussions with others who would like to partner with us in these efforts. As with all the work from the module development, our outputs and learning would be widely shared with the rest of the IATI community. We are determined that Bangladesh should remain at the cutting edge of the use of IATI data to increase impact and improve development outcomes.</span></p>",

Coordination is critical. Coherent, timely data is a key element of this complex response matrix and at the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016, 33 of the world\u2019s largest donors and humanitarian agencies <a href=\"https://consultations.worldhumanitariansummit.org/bitcache/075d4c18b82e0853e3d393e90af18acf734baf29?vid=581058&amp;disposition=inline&amp;op=view\">committed themselves</a> to \u201cidentifying and implementing a shared open-data standard and common digital platform which will enhance transparency and decision-making\u201d. The publishing <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/\">standard</a> maintained by the International Aid Transparency Initiative (<a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/\">IATI</a>) was recommended as the vehicle for this effort.</p><p>In preparation for this \u2018Grand Bargain\u2019 IATI has modified its standard to better meet the requirements of humanitarian reporting. These modifications were done in consultation with, amongst others, <a href=\"https://fts.unocha.org/\">OCHA\u2019s Financial Tracking Service</a> (FTS), the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/resources-campaigns/online-databases/edris-european-emergency-disaster-response-information-system_en\">European Emergency Disaster Response Information System</a> as well as organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\">UK Disasters Emergency Committee</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.startnetwork.org/\">Start Network</a>.</p><p>For humanitarian decision-making to be effectively harmonised, data from a variety of sources needs to be joined up. The way in which emergencies are defined and reported is an essential part of this. One improvement to the IATI Standard was thus the inclusion of a new element \u2013 <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/humanitarian-scope/\">humanitarian-scope</a> \u2013 which provides a means of accurately defining emergencies and appeals. This is done by specifying a \u2018vocabulary\u2019 \u2013 a globally recognised list of classifications \u2013 which maintains a curated list of codes.</p><p>For a standards body like IATI this raises a number of issues. Here are four considerations\u2026</p><ul>\n<li><strong>What recognised authority lists (vocabularies) exist?\u00a0</strong>No global classification system exists that encompasses all humanitarian emergencies. IATI and OCHA have agreed that the best approach for classifying emergencies is to adopt <a href=\"http://www.glidenumber.net/glide/public/search/search.jsp\">GLIDE numbers</a>, a <strong>Gl</strong>obal <strong>IDE</strong>ntifier coding system for natural disasters originally developed by the <a href=\"http://www.adrc.asia/\">Asian Disaster Reduction Center</a>. OCHA is a <a href=\"http://www.glidenumber.net/glide/public/institutions.jsp\">participating institution</a> and as such can generate new GLIDE numbers. Furthermore, there is agreement that the system can be extended to include man-made as well as natural disasters.For GLIDE to be recognised as the key global standard there is a need for all participating institutions to advocate for its adoption by all humanitarian-related information systems.</li>\n<li><strong>How are codes accessed?\u00a0</strong>Currently, users of the system are provided with email notifications of changes and can only access the database through manual downloads. This is far from ideal, particularly for data production in the early stages of a sudden-onset disaster.For GLIDE to progress it will have to be dynamically accessible by machines. Investment in a robust API that allows for automated discovery and retrieval of codes will be essential.</li>\n<li><strong>How are codes created and maintained?\u00a0</strong>Whenever a new emergency arises a participating institution can create a GLIDE number. If timely data is required urgently in sudden-onset emergencies there is little time for traditional methods of consultation and agreement between participating institutions. Furthermore, as IATI\u2019s reporting base grows there will be a need for the registration of local emergencies that may fall beneath the radar of the large participating institutions.There will thus be a need for a collaborative, technical framework that allows for rapid consultation and approval of new codes.</li>\n<li><strong>How will users of the data make sense of the codes?\u00a0</strong>Humanitarian financial and operational management has been developed in such a way that emergencies are defined and coded by country and year as well as by the disaster itself \u2212 multi-country and multi-year emergencies have new codes generated for each country and year. For a user of IATI data to analyse activities related to the West African Ebola epidemic a search would need to be done across 12 unique emergency codes (three countries over four years). The GLIDE number does also include an event-type code and \u201cEP (Epidemic)\u201d is one of them, but parsing identifiers is not easy.IATI will need to consider how to provide a searchable item to improve access to the data.</li>\n</ul><p>IATI is a voluntary standard. It has no power to enforce compliance. It is dependent on the good will of publishers and peer pressure from the humanitarian community as a whole. Improving humanitarian data will require collective efforts from all quarters.</p>",

Ostensibly, this data will improve project efficiency and effectiveness.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But are investments paying off? And what should the future of results management look like?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the</span><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/expertise/results/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Results Development Initiative</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (RDI), supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, we have spent the past year teasing out how we can better collect, share and use results data. Bounding our research to the countries of Ghana, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka, and the health and agriculture sectors, we tackled this challenge from two angles:</span></p><ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qualitatively, from the bottom-up, with a particular focus on the voices of local governments and organisations; and</span></li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quantitatively, from the top-down, looking at output and outcome data published by major development agencies.</span></li>\n</ul><p><b>From the bottom-up\u2026</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full qualitative findings can be found in</span><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/RDI-Ghana.pdf\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">each</span></a><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/RDI-Tanzania.pdf\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">country</span></a><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/RDI-SriLanka.pdf\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but across contexts we were able to identify four overarching themes critical for the open data community:</span></p><ul>\n<li><b><b>We are collecting too much data.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Front-line service providers are spending too much time collecting data that are neither useful nor used for decision-making. We strongly urge our colleagues to critically evaluate which indicators they collect, which they use, and</span><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/2016/03/03/results-indicators-costs-benefits/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how much those indicators cost</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></b></li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><b><b>We are not yet providing the right tools for local actors to meaningfully use data in project planning and management.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As a nonprofit that seeks to provide this type of technology, we\u2019re taking this to heart and critically evaluating how we can better empower local level analysis. As it stands, most data tools are a long way from achieving this goal.</span></b></li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><b><b>Often acknowledged but infrequently discussed, incentives are critical to promoting data use.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Existing structures do not necessarily reward those who use data to achieve results through promotions, recognition, or other incentives. We did find some \u2018power\u2019 data users and some government ministries where benchmarking performance, recognising exceptional data users, and leadership rhetoric helped galvanise data uptake \u2013 but we can and should do more.</span></b></li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><b><b>Finally, there\u2019s a disconnect between data collectors and data users \u2013 which takes a toll on data quality and uptake. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower-level officials are often tasked with collecting data, but are rarely told what this data could and should be used for, leading to low ownership and use. We recommend that senior officials give more proactive feedback around the value and use cases for data to local actors.</span></b></li>\n</ul><p><b>From the top-down\u2026</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a quantitative perspective, we wanted to determine whether we could take a look at big-picture results across major development partners. Like many organisations, we feel getting a bird\u2019s eye view of development activities can help all actors invest more efficiently and effectively.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team</span><a href=\"http://rdi.developmentgateway.org/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018joined up\u2019 a decade\u2019s worth of output and outcome data from 17 major donors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It took</span><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/2016/03/23/scraping-by-find-use-donor-results/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hundreds of hours</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to link up these indicators and we don\u2019t see a real business case for replicating this work in the future.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> some basic things that development agencies can do to make their results information more accessible and comparable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, we</span><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/2016/06/08/unlocking-development-results-data/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">noted five priority areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that could make results information more accurate, representative and informative. We are currently holding one-on-one consultations with development partners and others interested in learning more about our methodology and in improving results reporting.</span></p><p><b>So, what\u2019s next? </b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we seek smarter, more sustainable development solutions, collecting and using results data to greater effect only becomes more important. In the short term, any</span><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/expertise/results/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feedback on RDI findings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 questions, whether this information is helpful, or anecdotes from your experiences \u2013 would be much appreciated.

Our thoughts go out to his wife, Chloe, his family and all those touched by such a rich life cut tragically short.</span></p><p>Before Simon joined Development Initiatives he worked for the UK Department for International Development (DFID). This tribute, by Charles Agnew (DFID Head of Business Solutions), was posted on DFID\u2019s intranet:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<em>Simon worked for DFID for many years before joining Development Initiatives. He was an enthusiastic and inspirational person who made significant contributions to the use of technology in development programmes through PRISM, ARIES, the International Aid Transparency Initiative, and was instrumental in forming the Business Analysis function within DFID. He was a passionate advocate of improving the lives of people in developing countries and was well respected by the people he worked with and will be deeply missed. Our thoughts are with Simon\u2019s wife Chloe and his family at this difficult time</em>.\u201d</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At DI Simon spent his first year leading up to the Accra High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness collecting the evidence and building the case for transparent, timely and forward-looking data \u2013 encapsulated in a</span><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IATI-scoping-paper-2009.pdf\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoping Paper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which was finally published in early 2009. This intellectual work underpinned the creation of IATI in Accra in September 2008.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon immediately became a key member of the IATI Secretariat. Together with </span><b><i>Brian Hammond</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, then Chair of the Technical Advisory Group, he was responsible for building the IATI Standard, distilling the disparate views of a broad range of interested organisations. According to Brian,</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201c<em>Simon had that rare ability to combine understanding of the aid business and its information needs with a knowledge of applying new and emerging technologies to meet those needs. His skills were fundamental in providing leadership and technical guidance to the IATI Technical Advisory Group from its inception to agreement on the IATI Standard in 2011. The proof of this is shown by the adoption and use of the standard by nearly 500 organisations so far. His friendliness and infectious enthusiasm will be sorely missed by all those who were lucky enough to work with him</em>.\u201d</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A critical part of the work building the standard involved understanding the needs of developing countries and translating these into technical demands that were acceptable to their development partners. Country work was led by </span><b><i>Danila Boneva</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who represented UNDP on the Secretariat from 2009 to 2011. Danila reflects:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201c<em>I will always remember Simon smiling and laughing off all adversaries and controversies surrounding the initiative in its early days. All doubts were cast away; all excruciating technical questions had a response in Simon and we could just focus on the tasks in front of us and look for solutions. Simon was incredibly talented and modest, which is a rare combination. He always looked for the best in people, in situations, in problem-solving. His whole personality was one of a humane human being, someone that understood others and would help them when they needed it. Being a member of the early IATI team remains an unforgettable experience because of people like Simon and the rest of the wonderful colleagues I worked with in 2009-2011</em>.\u201d</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IATI Standard became operational at the beginning of 2011. </span><b><i>Alasdair Wardhaugh</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from DFID was the coordinator of the Secretariat at that time. He attests:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<em>I worked closely with Simon on creating the IATI Standard, when he used his intellect and passion to sell the concept to the world\u2019s biggest (and until then least transparent) donors. IATI\u2019s expansion was hugely down to his efforts. \u00a0But it was always about the end not the means for him and his work to empower civil society in Nepal through information has been transformational</em>.\u201d</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was fitting that it was Simon that led the presentation of IATI in Busan in November 2011. At that stage we could boast 17 publishers. Over the next couple of years his stewardship of the IATI Technical Team saw this number rise steadily. According to </span><b><i>John Adams</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, current TAG Chair:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<em>Simon always had a clear vision for IATI and worked tirelessly to bring that to fruition. His deep knowledge, strong passion and infectious enthusiasm made him fabulously effective. He built strong relationships with such a wide range of people, and this was fundamental in gaining broad support for IATI. IATI would have got nowhere without Simon. I will miss his support, advice and ideas which were of real help to me in my role within DFID and as Chair of the IATI TAG</em>.\u201d</span></p><p>In 2013 Simon shifted his responsibilities to a broader leadership role within Development Initiatives, focussing more on the demand side of the information ecosystem, recognising that the IATI project will come to nothing unless the data is properly used. As recently as a month ago, over two years into his debilitating battle with cancer, Simon was analysing the challenges of mapping IATI data to the SDGs.</p><p>If you would like to share your memories of Simon, please do so on the IATI <a href=\"http://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/remembering-simon/512\" target=\"_blank\">Discuss forum</a>.

As a first, IATI Studio offers a dedicated Chart Builder, which provides a simple interface to help you </span><a href=\"https://app.iatistudio.com/app\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create interactive charts based on IATI data</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This way, non-technical users can easily master working with IATI Studio, start mixing data and engage a broader community.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An increase of IATI data publishers provides new opportunities to support sustainable development. Using these new sources will create new insights and knowledge. With the expected increase of new organisations publishing to IATI, IATI Studio will bring about a major benefit to all stakeholders involved.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By providing a common toolbox for the IATI Standard, IATI data will become available for reuse by potentially everyone inside and out of the international aid transparency community.

So if you\u2019ve ever wondered whether someone\u2019s data is up to date, or if you can see what their planned budgets are for 2018, here\u2019s how!</span></p><p>Every night the Dashboard checks through everyone\u2019s data and looks for changes so it can update itself, meaning that it\u2019s an excellent real time barometer of how all publishers are doing on the four dimensions of good IATI data \u2013 timeliness, forward-looking, comprehensiveness and coverage. Let\u2019s look at what these mean in simple terms:</p><p><b>Timeliness</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is made up of two things:</span></p><ul>\n<li><b><b>How often a publisher updates their data</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (frequency)</span></b></li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><b>How old the data is</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (time lag)</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequency table</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the Dashboard shows a column for each of the last twelve months and a figure to show how many days that publisher changed their transaction dates in each month. The last column shows an overall assessment of how often a publisher is updating their data, based on </span><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html#h_assesment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">these criteria</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can sort the table by publisher name, overall frequency, or by month. There is a column for the current month but this is not included in the overall assessment. The same applies for </span><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness_timelag.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time Lag</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><b>Forward-looking</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put simply, forward-looking information means whether the publisher has provided budgets for the current year and two subsequent years for their IATI activities. The Dashboard </span><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/forwardlooking.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forward-looking table</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lets you look at how many \u2018live\u2019 activities a particular publisher has at the beginning of a year, how many of these have budgets attached to them and then calculates a percentage. You can sort on either the number / percentage or by year.</span></p><p><b>Comprehensiveness</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dashboard provides a </span><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of three different areas of publishers\u2019 data, as well as the individual statistics on each individual area.</span></p><ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_core.html\"><b>Core</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 as the name suggests, these are what we think are the most important bits of information to include in an IATI activity</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_financials.html\"><b>Financials</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 key transaction and budget information</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_valueadded.html\"><b>Value added</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 fields that make IATI data richer and more useful</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comprehensiveness table</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the Dashboard shows a weighted average across the three areas listed above, as well as an average for each area. You can also dig into the individual areas in more detail on the links above.</span></p><p><b>Coverage</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coverage refers to what percentage of expenditure is being reported to IATI by each organisation. To calculate this, we look at the total spend amount reported to IATI by an organisation in a given year and then compare it with an external source to get a percentage coverage score. The </span><a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/coverage.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coverage table</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the Dashboard can be sorted by IATI spend, reference spend (from the external source) and the resulting coverage ratio and percentage.</span></p><p><b>The Global Partnership Transparency Indicator</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last December marked the deadline for signatories of the </span><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/development/effectiveness/busanpartnership.htm#\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2011 Busan Partnership Agreement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to meet their commitment to a \u2018common, open standard for electronic publication of timely, comprehensive and forward-looking information on resources provided through development co-operation\u2019.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2011, much progress has been made.

The programme aimed to integrate the use of IATI data in the operational practices of partner country ministries of finance and planning via Aid Information Management Systems (AIMS). <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five countries that use</span><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/expertise/information-management/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> DG\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agreed to participate in the study: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chad, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Madagascar, Senegal and\u00a0Burkina Faso (the work programme in Burkina Faso was delayed due to political instability in the country during 2015).</span></span></p><p><b>What did you learn </b><b>from the project about IATI data use?</b></p><p><b><b>Countries had heard of, but never used IATI data</b></b><br/>\nAt the beginning of the programme, the majority of government staff participants had heard of IATI, but most had never used IATI data before in their work.</p><p><img alt=\"Have you ever heard of IATI\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3814 alignright\" height=\"302\" sizes=\"(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2.png 997w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2-450x136.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2-768x233.png 768w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-heard-of-IATI-2-600x182.png 600w\" width=\"997\"/><b><b>IATI provides a huge amount of aid information previously unknown to governments</b></b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, the import of selected IATI data resulted in the addition of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid flow data, which were previously \u2018blind spots\u2019 for the country governments.

It is not surprising therefore that Bangladesh is keen to use IATI data to enhance its Aid Information Management System (AIMS).</p><p>As the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) uses a locally developed AIMS and owns the source code, they are able to flexibly and cheaply make whatever changes and improvements to the system they want. With the support of UNDP, they have contracted a great local IT company (<a href=\"http://www.technovista.com.bd/\">Technovista</a>) to develop a way to easily import IATI data to the AIMS.</p><p><strong>Getting good data is a challenge for all AIMS</strong><br/>\nAIMS are important tools to capture information about development cooperation at a country level and are vital platforms for coordinating and overseeing activities funded and implemented by a large number of different actors. To do this they need basic data on the projects all actors are planning and implementing.</p><p>Manual data entry takes time and effort, and data quality suffers as a result. The increasing availability of IATI data is an opportunity to lower the burden of data entry and get higher quality data available for stakeholders in aid recipient countries to analyse.</p><p><strong>Challenges in using IATI data</strong><br/>\nThere is now a<a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/busan-endorsers-significantly-improve-iati-data-quality\"> large amount of data published in IATI</a>. Given this, questions have been raised about the very limited use of IATI data in country systems. The lack of use has been a source of frustration for organisations that have invested considerable resources in IATI \u00a0and in their own data publication. Our work in Bangladesh is identifying some of the difficulties faced by enthusiastic partner countries:</p><p><em>Complexity in the aid system</em>: Country level systems need to be able to handle the same project being reported by multiple organisations from different perspectives. Multiple reporting is encouraged in IATI as publishers provide data independently of each-other, and because a much wider range of organisations (including implementers) can publish. This complexity is inherent in the aid system \u2013 where money is frequently\u00a0pooled or passed around between organisations \u2013 and there are significant benefits to having multiple reporters. However, in IATI the burden of coordination (removing double counting) is currently shifted downstream to the end users. If more publishers correctly used the traceability components of the IATI Standard this situation would improve. For the foreseeable future, AIMS that use IATI data will need to rely on humans \u2013 particularly staff in donor country offices \u2013 to interpret the data.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Differing donor approaches to providing IATI data</em>: Data quality is not a precise term and varies wildly depending on the \u2018for what/who\u2019. At country level, key quality features are whether details such as the implementing agency is named, and translations given in the national language. Some donors publish data with aggregated financials or without grouping data into recognisable projects, or publish data too infrequently to be useful.</p><p>We will not be implementing any donor-specific \u2018hacks\u2019 to deal with these difficulties. Instead, we will contact donors and inform them of these problems, encouraging them to address them. There should be a strong business case here for donors to address these issues, as it should save a large amount of staff time from manually re-keying data that could otherwise be imported. The forthcoming publication of <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/2016-aid-transparency-index/\">Publish What You Fund\u2019s 2016 Aid Transparency Index</a> should also help to focus minds on data quality.</p><p>Due to these challenges, IATI data doesn\u2019t yet flow to recipient countries as smoothly as might be imagined. However, this will not prevent us from using the wealth of good data that <em>is</em> now available. Our solution is to build an interface to allow humans to make sensible decisions when importing IATI data, explaining how activities fit together, and at what level, to create meaningful projects, adding in missing data and clarifying that status of the data with in-country representatives as they go.</p><p><strong>Where we will get to by May</strong><br/>\nWe have a very tight (and ambitious!) timescale for development, which must be complete within the next three months. By then, we aim to have developed an interface which can import data from any organisation publishing IATI data. Donors will continue to be responsible for reporting their projects to the Bangladeshi AIMS and it will be up to them to decide whether their IATI data is an accurate reflection of their activities or whether they prefer to use other data sources. We will provide tools to help them make these decisions.</p><p>We are also conscious of the opportunity to create some useful public goods out of this process. The software Technovista are developing is open source and openly licensed: it will continue to be published on <a href=\"http://github.com/bd-iati/edi\">Github\u00a0</a>as we progress. The methodology, documentation, and development process is being recorded on a <a href=\"http://bd-iati.github.io\">microsite</a>. We are also using this platform to collect the issues we find in using donors\u2019 data. This is useful for us to refer back to and point donors towards, but we hope it will also be a helpful resource for others working on importing IATI data to country systems in the future.</p><p><strong>Moving from data collection to aid effectiveness</strong><br/>\n2016 can be the year that we demonstrate the power of IATI to reduce the burden of data collection, improve data quality and, ultimately, use the data to improve aid effectiveness. We\u2019re working hard to make that possible at the country level, and we will be happy to be held accountable for delivering on our commitments at the IATI Members\u2019 Assembly meeting in June.</p><p>We can only work with the data that\u2019s available \u2013 and some donors still need to catch up with the rest on the quality of data they are publishing. But with a wealth of good-quality data now out there, it really is time to start using the data that is available \u2013 and rewarding those donors that have made progress with a lighter workload.</p>",

For example, the Central Bank of Liberia, the Legislature and the Department of Budget and Macro-fiscal Unit at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning. </span></p><p><b>How else is IATI data used? </b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IATI data supports the GoL in the preparation of its macroeconomic framework, national budget preparation and increases transparency and accountability of ODA to Liberia. The data also helps to inform the national Legislature about donors operating in their constituencies. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also share our entire data set with Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) economists, as it supports the production of Liberia\u2019s Balance of Payments.</span></p><p><b>Do you have any advice to countries considering using IATI data?</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recommend other countries use IATI data in the context of the aid data collection process. It helps to provide more realistic information and makes your analysis more credible. IATI data also provides an opportunity to find funding information about donors who are not stationed in your country, and provides a good basis to build communication links with them. I think it is advisable to always cross-check the data with donors on the ground before publication.</span></p><p><b>Do you have any difficulties using IATI data? </b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not with the IATI system, but we could benefit from help to cross-check IATI data with donors that do not have an office in Liberia, as we require sign-off from all donors before we use or publish their data. \u00a0</span></p><p><b>What are your future plans regarding IATI?</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Government of Liberia is anticipating upgrading its Aid Management Platform (AMP) with the IATI import module, so that we can bring IATI data into our own systems and look at it alongside our existing data. We\u2019re also engaging again as a member of IATI and participating in meetings of the initiative.</span></p>",

Welcome announcements were made, including significant voluntary contributions for 2016-17 from the Hewlett Foundation and the European Commission, and new memberships, including the Republic of Korea and InterAction, with formal membership steps also expected soon for Guinea, FAO, WHO and UNIDO.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/evaluation\">evaluation</a> of IATI undertaken in 2015 proved to be a good starting point for discussions. The excellent groundwork undertaken by the interim<a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/steering-committee/steering-committee-sub-groups\">\u00a0Members\u2019 Advisory Group</a> to prepare detailed recommendations around governance, strategic vision and hosting helped the Steering Committee to come to some concrete decisions at the meeting. Members agreed to establish a Governing Board representing donors, civil society, partner countries and the technical community. The Board will have responsibility for preparing recommendations for approval by the Members\u2019 Assembly, which will meet annually and will contribute to decision-making between meetings through a virtual process. Members also agreed to ask the current\u00a0IATI <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/secretariat\">Secretariat</a> to continue their work for a maximum of\u00a0two further years\u00a0beyond the current term (which would have expired in August 2016) and requested that the Board develop recommendations during this period for more permanent institutional arrangements for IATI.</p><p><img alt=\"SC_detail\" class=\" wp-image-3657 alignright\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SC_detail.jpg\" width=\"233\"/>Through the innovative use of online collaborative tools, the Secretariat was able to record the essence of facilitated conversations taking place around eleven small tables on topics such as IATI\u2019s role\u00a0in the 2030 agenda as a standard that can capture data on all international resources for development; those inputs were used as references in later plenary sessions.</p><p>When asked about the potential for rebranding IATI, members were keen on retaining the acronym whilst agreeing that IATI should lose the \u2018Aid\u2019 word in order to promote greater inclusivity and reflect its potential to capture data on all international resources. The Board was asked to establish a process for looking in more depth at the question of branding while\u00a0it also considers\u00a0the\u00a0longer term vision for IATI.</p><p>The technical team shared highlights from the new <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/iati-upgrade-to-version-2-02-goes-live\">upgrade to version 2.02</a> of the Standard which went live on December 7, following a rigorous process of consultation ahead of the meetings. This makes the Standard fit for purpose for the humanitarian community, adding new optional fields, and enabling publishers to report data in real time via a humanitarian marker for fast-tracking publication of humanitarian activities. With v2.02 all publishers\u00a0are now able to report progress against the\u00a0Sustainable Development Goals, with goals and targets already incorporated and a placeholder for indicators once these are agreed. These new fields give IATI an important edge in terms of monitoring SDG activity at country level and members are encouraged to use the new fields as early as possible.</p><p>In discussions on the Transparency Indicator of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC), members gave support for the <a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/transparencyindicator.html\">methodology and assessment</a> of IATI data through the <a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/\">Dashboard</a> which now includes the dimensions of <a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html\">timeliness</a>, <a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness.html\">comprehensiveness</a> and <a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/forwardlooking.html\">forward-looking</a> as highlighted in the Busan transparency commitment. Members were concerned that, while the GPEDC Joint Support Team\u2019s proposal for combining the IATI component with the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and Forward Spending Survey (FSS) may be technically sound, it is overly complex and therefore of limited political value in encouraging donors to improve their transparency.</p><p>IATI was pleased to launch its latest <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/annualreport2015/\">Annual Report</a>\u00a0which contains several excellent case studies from publishers and users of IATI data. The report is available\u00a0in English, with executive summaries in French and Spanish.</p><p>Given the short timeline for establishing the new governance structures ahead of the next meeting of members in June 2016 (TBC), the Chair asked the interim Members\u2019 Advisory Group (MAG) to continue its work and encouraged other members to volunteer to assist the MAG in some of its workstreams on implementing the new governance structures, developing IATI\u2019s strategic vision, improving data use at country level and moving towards permanent hosting arrangements.</p><p><img alt=\"Robin Uyterlinde\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3655\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robin-Uyterlinde.jpg\" width=\"232\"/><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Finally, members bid farewell and gave warm thanks to the Steering Committee Chair, Robin Uyterlinde, who has completed his two year tenure. He was happy to leave IATI on such a high note and remarked on some of the excellent advances that have taken place during </span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">his time in the role,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">\u00a0including the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">growth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">\u00a0to more than 360 publishers reflecting more than US$78bn of development resources reported through IATI.

Driven from Belfast to Dublin? Or packed the wrong adaptor for a business trip? If so, you may have noticed that standards are persistent. Spanish railways have been built to a different gauge from the rest of Europe since 1845. It took the Republic of Ireland 30 years to switch from miles to kilometres. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone are neighbours but each uses a different shape of plug.</p><p>Data standards are less visible, but suffer from a similar problem: different standards mean you can describe the same thing in different, often inconsistent, ways. Take a simple example: how many small island states are there in the world? It turns out there are at least six different answers, ranging from 23 to 50, depending on who you ask.</p><p><img alt=\"JUDS_small_island_states\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3547\" height=\"526\" sizes=\"(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JUDS_small_island_states.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JUDS_small_island_states.png 995w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JUDS_small_island_states-450x238.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JUDS_small_island_states-600x317.png 600w\" width=\"995\"/></p><p><em>1: Slides from Conrad Zellmann\u2019s presentation depicting the divergence in definitions of small island states between major international institutions</em></p><p>On 28 October 2015, we co-organised an <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/blog-editor/2015/10/21/turning-more-data-better-information-role-joined-data-standards-meeting\">event on joined-up data standards</a> at the <a href=\"http://ogpsummit.org/\">Open Government Partnership Summit</a> (OGP15) in Mexico City. Through a series of lightening talks moderated by Martin Tisn\u00e9 of the <a href=\"https://www.omidyar.com/people/martin-tisn%C3%A9\">Omidyar Network</a>: Ania Calderon from the <a href=\"http://en.presidencia.gob.mx/\">Government of Mexico</a>, Georg Neumann from the <a href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/\">Open Contracting Partnership</a>, Conrad Zellmann from <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/\">Development Initiatives</a> and Rupert Simons from <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\">Publish What You Fund</a> explored the value that joining-up data standards can create for open data standard setters, producers and users alike.</p><p>As first-time OGPers, what struck us both about the event was just how much of a need for joined-up conversations between major open data standard-setters (including IATI, Open Contracting, HXL, and others), data producers and users there currently is. In 2015, the need for joined-up conversations has intensified as a result of the exciting policy developments taking place at the international level. Within the context of the renewal of the international development agenda and the setting of the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs), a rare phenomenon has occurred \u2013 a multi-stakeholder consensus across public policy and open data communities has emerged \u2013 recognising a need not just for more and better data generation but for the creation of <em>better</em> <em>information </em>to drive policy-making and accountability efforts in future.</p><p>Joining-up existing open data standards across policy sectors is only one small component of broader efforts to create better information, but it is a key component. Its value has been acknowledged at the highest levels of the international development community and the need for interoperability is recognised within the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/07/Addis-Ababa-Action-Agenda-Draft-Outcome-Document-7-July-2015.pdf\">Addis Ababa Action Agenda</a> (AAAA) (para. 128). Moreover, within the broader context of the <a href=\"http://www.undatarevolution.org/\">Data Revolution</a>, the need to ensure interoperability and compatibility between data standards has been enshrined as a fundamental open data principle within the new <a href=\"http://opendatacharter.net/\">International Open Data Charter</a> (IODC) (Principle 4).</p><p>Translating these principles into a more practical example at last week\u2019s event, Georg framed the value of joined-up data as being, \u201crelevant to so many of the SDGs in helping us to follow the money through contracts, aid and budgets\u201d. Linked to this example, Beata Lisowska, a Data Scientist at Development Initiatives working on joined-up data standards, has recently mapped the relationship between sector definitions within the <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=4\">classification of functions of government</a> (COFOG) standard, used by the UN system, and the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1\">creditor reporting system</a> (CRS), used by the OECD. Excitingly, this cross-mapping, if linked to SDG indicators, could eventually be used as a tool to estimate whether or not SDG goals are being sufficiently funded.</p><p>Now that consensus on the <em>need</em> has been achieved, it is crucial that conversations across interest-groups and policy sectors are joined-up to generate consensus on <em>how</em> interoperability can be achieved. As Conrad put it, \u201cwe want to be able to translate between existing standards to make data comparable and speak the same language in key areas \u2013 i.e. to make data interoperable\u201d. This implies that standard setters, data producers and users all have to take part in the same conversation. Reflecting on her own experiences, Ania commented that, \u201cin Mexico, we partnered national statistics institutions and the open data community to help join-up data\u201d. This is no mean feat given the divergence in methodologies, objectives and incentives that exist, even within a single government. The politics inherent to joining-up data standards was identified almost immediately at the event, and one of the very first questions from the audience was, \u201chow do you overcome politics to join-up data standards?\u201d In answering the question, Rupert pointed out that the only way to do this is to, \u201cbuild a coalition of parties who gain from interoperability\u201d. Achieving this will require fostering a new global consensus.</p><p>The recognition of the need for interoperable data standards within the IODC and the AAAA offers intergovernmental and multilateral bodies, individual governments, corporate bodies and civil society organisations a unique opportunity to join-up their conversations. As Martin so eloquently put it, \u201cdata sings when it is joined-up\u201d. The challenge moving forward then is for open data standard setters, producers and users to put their voices together to make the data sing.</p>",

This blog <a href=\"http://www.interaction.org/newsroom/blog/%E2%80%9Cone-click%E2%80%9D-publishing-iati\" target=\"_blank\">was originally published</a>\u00a0on InterAction\u2019s website on 3 November 2015.</em></p><p>InterAction has just published information on its grant-funded activities to the <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/\">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)</a> for the third time. Since <a href=\"https://www.interaction.org/blog/lessons-road-transparency-four-tips-publishing-iati\">first publishing in March 2015</a>, we\u2019ve considerably improved our publication process. It\u2019s only a slight exaggeration to say that we can now publish to IATI with just one click of a button. In case it might be of use to others, here\u2019s how we did it.</p><p>Though the process we set up to publish the first and second time certainly got the job done, it was far from efficient. This is what it looked like (individuals involved are in italics and tools in bold blue text):</p><p><img alt=\"old_iati_process\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3542\" height=\"271\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/old_iati_process.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/old_iati_process.jpg 621w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/old_iati_process-450x196.jpg 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/old_iati_process-600x262.jpg 600w\" width=\"621\"/></p><p>Some might fairly ask why we didn\u2019t just use <a href=\"http://www.aidstream.org/\">AidStream</a>, a tool that would have allowed us to simply enter our grant information and then publish to IATI directly. The most important reason is that we needed this grant data for our own internal purposes. Using AidStream as a grant management tool was not an option because we capture additional data on grants beyond what is covered by IATI. We also didn\u2019t want to make grant managers manually enter data in two places: the grant forms and AidStream. So although this process did take some time to set up, in the short-term it was slightly more efficient than the alternatives.</p><p>Even at the time, however, we knew this process would not be sustainable. And indeed, once our resource development manager left \u2013 which meant their role in the process fell to the IATI lead \u2013 we made it a priority to streamline the process.</p><p>Around this time, we learned that we could make use of the Salesforce database InterAction has been transitioning to. Working with our IT director and another tech-savvy colleague, we created a more comprehensive version of the grant form in Salesforce using the \u201cOpportunities\u201d functionality. This is what our process looks like now:</p><p><img alt=\"new_iati_process\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3543 aligncenter\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/new_iati_process.jpg\" width=\"439\"/></p><p>We are thrilled to have gotten to this point. Though we will continue making tweaks, the process is now so simple that anyone at InterAction could conceivably serve as the \u201cIATI lead.\u201d In other words, InterAction\u2019s publication to IATI is no longer dependent on the expertise of one or two people.</p><p>As happy as we are to have gotten here, the process was admittedly painful. Making sense of what IATI requires was much more time consuming than it should have been. Setting things up in Salesforce was similarly difficult and complicated. Fortunately, that actually had an upside: after struggling unsuccessfully to get Salesforce to generate a file with all the grant information we needed for IATI, my colleague discovered he could just write a code that would generate an IATI XML file (for those who\u2019d like to see this code, visit <a href=\"https://github.com/InteractionNGO/publishing-iati-data-with-salesforce\">this GitHub page</a>). This breakthrough allowed us to simplify the publication process even more than we\u2019d hoped, as we no longer need to use the <a href=\"http://csv2iati.iatistandard.org/docs/user_guide.html\">IATI2CSV converter</a>.</p><p>Based on our experience, we\u2019d like to offer the IATI community two recommendations:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>For the IATI Secretariat</strong>: Invest in improving the guidance for publishing to IATI. As it is, publishing to IATI remains a daunting task, turning off many who might be willing to publish voluntarily.</li>\n<li><strong>For IATI publishers</strong>: Don\u2019t just write about why you\u2019re publishing to IATI, but also <em>how</em>. This will help others trying to figure out their own process, and make it possible to identify pain points that new tools or changes to existing tools could help solve.</li>\n</ul>",

We believe that joining-up data on aid, contracts, budgets, humanitarian assistance and other development-related data offers an exciting new frontier for open data and its ability to support efforts to tackle global development issues. Through the JDA, IATI can work with other data standard communities, to encourage user-centric design in the creation of standards and share common methodologies and coding systems in fields such as geospatial data, functional sectors and organisational, corporate and demographic identifiers.</p><p>Collaboration on areas such as these can mean that data is more comparable across different standards. This could enable easier tracing of, for example development cooperation flows, following them from donors, through implementing partners, to recipient governments and procurement systems, and even down to the beneficiary level.</p><p>Momentum is building in the area of joined-up data with the second launch of <a href=\"http://opendatacharter.net/\">International Open Data Charter</a> in Mexico this week. The Charter offers a way to join up silos of disconnected data on resource flows and socio-economic indicators, highlighting that: \u201cWhen\u00a0data can be effectively combined and compared, it can help highlight trends, identify\u00a0social and economic challenges and inequities, and benchmark progress in public\u00a0programs and services\u201d.</p><p>Under principle four of the charter, signatories pledge to \u201cengage with domestic and international standards bodies and other standard setting\u00a0initiatives to encourage increased interoperability between existing\u00a0international standards, support the creation of common, global data standards\u00a0where they do not already exist, and ensure that any new data standards we create\u00a0are, to the greatest extent possible, interoperable with existing standards\u201d.</p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3533\" style=\"width: 505px\"><a href=\"http://opendatacharter.net/\"><img alt=\"Open Data Charter Principles\" class=\"wp-image-3533\" height=\"158\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Open-Data-Charter-Principles-450x136.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The principles of the Open Data Charter (Source: www.opendatacharter.net/)</p></div><p>IATI is excited to be part of increased international efforts to bring together data standards in an effort to enable more effective use of data.

Supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\u2019s (DFAT) <a href=\"https://innovationxchange.dfat.gov.au/\">innovationxchange</a>, the project will seek to support better monitoring and evaluation of nutrition programmes.</p><p>This is a really exciting and novel use of the IATI Standard to track aid program outcomes, and is welcomed by the IATI Secretariat as a positive step forward in the use of IATI data. We spoke to <a href=\"http://www.catalpa.io/about_us.html\">David Roach</a>, Catalpa International Director and Co-Founder, about the project.</p><p><strong>What are the plans for the project so far?</strong></p><p>The plan is to provide a monitoring and evaluation system to better address the issue of malnutrition, by making it easier for programme implementers to report activities, expenditure and results directly to DFAT in an IATI compliant format. Catalpa will deploy our \u2018Openly\u2019 Open Data Information Management software as the backbone of this system. Openly is already being used in <a href=\"http://www.catalpa.io/project_feature_mohinga.html\">Myanmar</a> to track donor aid flows with great success.</p><p>Malnutrition in Timor-Leste is a major concern, with 50 per cent of children under five years experiencing stunting \u2013 one of the highest rates globally. We\u2019ve been based in Timor-Leste for close to eight years and have seen the impact malnutrition has on Timor\u2019s overall development. When the opportunity came up to build on our existing partnership with DFAT, we jumped at the chance to help make a positive impact in the communities in which we work.</p><p><strong>How do you hope to use the results information?</strong></p><p>Firstly, we\u2019re going to use the <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/\">IATI Standard</a> to coordinate the collection of activity results across partners. Partners from a number of sectors will be working under a shared monitoring and evaluation framework, reporting all their activity outcomes online. At Catalpa, we\u2019ll be aggregating this results data across all of the partners and tracking their collective progress in as near real-time as possible.</p><p>The second part of the project will use mobile technology to gather information around impact, for such things as anaemia levels and under-nutrition, so that DFAT and its implementing partners will be able to see how activity outcomes are influencing nutrition rates.</p><p>We will be also exploring the use of biometrics to collect results over smart-phones, and other technology to simplify and improve the quality of data collected in a low resource settings.</p><p><strong>Will the data be made publicly available? </strong></p><p>Yes, this is one of the reasons why we are so excited about the project. Over time we will be working with DFAT to create a series of interactive, publicly accessible dashboards and other online tools, so partners and the general public will be able to track the same information as DFAT staff in Dili and Canberra.</p><p><strong>What do you hope the benefits of this project will be to DFAT, its implementing partners, and citizens of Timor-Leste in general? </strong></p><p>For DFAT, this is an opportunity to support greater coordination among their implementing partners and provide a stronger focus on assessing the effectiveness of aid programmes in a more efficient manner. At the same time, it allows DFAT to connect with implementing partners in a simpler way, as well as fulfilling their international obligations to increasing aid transparency.</p><p>For the implementing partners, this will hopefully streamline reporting requirements and allow them to devote resources to achieving results and better value for money for the donor. The idea is that when data is open and shareable across DFATs implementing partners, it can be aggregated together to promote better analysis, leading to more efficient and effective allocation of effort and resources.</p><p>And for the citizens of Timor-Leste, we think this will be one of, if not the first, aid activity that is monitored in real time in a public way. As access to the internet and mobile phones increases, not just in Dili but throughout rural areas, we think there will be a greater demand for this type of initiative.</p><p><strong><em>For further information on Catalpa and their projects you can visit their </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.catalpa.io/\">website</a><strong><em>.

This in turn enables governments to know who is working in their country, citizens to hold governments and service providers to account, and NGOs to showcase their work and become more accountable to their donors. There is also a huge benefit in terms of increasing collaboration and learning between organisations when they share comprehensive data.</p><p><strong>New Features</strong></p><p>At the beginning of September, Akvo launched the <a href=\"http://akvo.org/blog/a-brand-new-project-editor-for-akvo-rsr/\">RSR project editor</a> providing more flexibility for organisations to publish data and use it for monitoring, evaluation and communications. The new features include:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Project Editor</strong> \u2013 this allows organisations to add, edit and publish project data directly. It is divided into user-friendly sections with guidance that makes it easier for organisations to fill in the data, with progress bars to indicate how many mandatory fields have been completed.</li>\n<li><strong>Meeting IATI publishing requirements</strong> \u2013 recognising that more of their partners wanted to publish to the IATI Standard, RSR 3.0\u2019s project editor allows organisation to publish more complete information that meets IATI\u2019s requirements. This is done through a simple option to show extra IATI fields in the project editor area of the website.</li>\n</ol><p>Further developments are envisaged for the coming months, including a system that will visualise the results of each project, showing how organisations and projects contribute to specific goals.</p><p><strong>How are organisations using Akvo RSR?</strong></p><ol>\n<li><strong> Cordaid</strong></li>\n</ol><p><a href=\"https://www.cordaid.org/\">Cordaid</a> is one of the Netherland\u2019s largest development aid organisations, focusing on development and collaboration in vulnerable regions and areas of conflict.

Akvo\u2019s RSR tool was integrated into the website along with Akvo\u2019s own project management system, allowing staff from countries around the world to report more easily, and in line with the IATI Standard. Cordaid\u2019s project portfolio is now <a href=\"https://www.cordaid.org/en/projects/\">visualised on their website</a>, allowing users to easily search for projects and see essential project information ranging from budgets, locations, goals and partners.

For an organisation with hundreds of partners and thousands of supporters and volunteers, ATLAS is an essential tool to share information and knowledge with this large constituency. As an interactive world map, users can search for projects and programmes by keyword, country and theme, and find information including project names, budgets, expenditures, descriptions and partners.</p><p>We discussed the ATLAS tool and open data with Leo Stolk, Oxfam Novib\u2019s ATLAS Project Leader.</p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3474\" style=\"width: 639px\"><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ATLAS-Screenshot-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3474\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ATLAS-Screenshot-1-450x198.jpg\" width=\"629\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>A screenshot of the Oxfam Novib ATLAS interface</em></p></div><p>IATI data is used to drive ATLAS, combined with other data coming from Oxfam Novib\u2019s internal systems, to ensure users have a detailed and context-based understanding of their projects. This includes images, documents and contact details for the projects. Data is refreshed every evening to ensure users have access to the most up to date information about projects.</p><p>There are currently over 2,400 programmes and projects being reported. Following widely recognised open data best practices, Oxfam Novib publish as many projects as possible but, as noted in their <a href=\"http://www.oxfamnovib.nl/Redactie/Downloads/IATI%20Open%20Data/Open%20Information%20Policy.pdf?_ga=1.263278092.1043275448.1440771222\">Open Information Policy</a>, exclude any information that would put staff security at risk or cause potential harm to their operations.</p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3475\" style=\"width: 460px\"><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ATLAS-financial-information-screenshot.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3475 size-medium\" height=\"348\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ATLAS-financial-information-screenshot-450x348.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ATLAS-financial-information-screenshot-450x348.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ATLAS-financial-information-screenshot.png 475w\" width=\"450\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>An example of some of the financial data available in ATLAS</em></p></div><p>Significantly, for Leo Stolk at Oxfam Novib, ATLAS is important because it makes raw data accessible and easy to use. While you can access Oxfam Novib\u2019s data from the <a href=\"http://iatiregistry.org\">IATI registry</a>, this raw, open data can be difficult to read and use. With ATLAS, the raw information is placed into context, making it more attractive and useful. This allows sponsors, journalists, partners and others to see how the money is being spent, and even compare Oxfam Novib\u2019s work with that of other development organisations through tools such as <a href=\"http://www.openaid.nl/\">openaid.nl</a>, which are also driven by IATI data.</p><p>Internally, and among partners, the data in ATLAS is an essential learning and knowledge sharing tool. ATLAS doesn\u2019t only show Oxfam\u2019s successes, but also those projects that may not have gone as planned. \u201cThis is what open data means, everything is public,\u201d says Leo. \u201cThat is scary in the beginning, but eventually it will make us better at what we do. It forces us to be critical and improve things that don\u2019t work.\u201d Furthermore, it can enable essential knowledge sharing between partners working on the same issues and projects in and across countries. Searching ATLAS to find comparable projects means partner organisations can join forces and share knowledge proactively.</p><p>Leo also notes that publishing to IATI and developing ATLAS has encouraged the organisation to think more about the data they are entering into their project administration systems: poor data in, poor data out; \u201cHopefully, Atlas inspires project teams to register their projects properly.\u201d The Oxfam Novib website also <a href=\"http://www.oxfamnovib.nl/Open-Data.html\">encourages users to provide feedback</a> on the datasets they access, so that they can be improved.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the final step for Oxfam Novib: the ATLAS team are already working on a new version that will be accessible on mobile devices, which will enable users to access data anywhere, at any time. Other Oxfam affiliates will also be including their data in ATLAS in the coming months, with Oxfam GB and Oxfam India following in the steps of their Dutch colleagues in making their IATI data more accessible, and easy to use. According to Leo, \u201cATLAS will be most effective as it is used by as many affiliates as possible. Then you get a clear overview of Oxfam\u2019s work around the world.\u201d</p><p><strong><em>If you\u2019re interested in learning more about how your organisation can become more transparent and want to publish to IATI, visit the website <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net\">www.aidtransparency.net</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:info@iatistandard.org\">info@iatistandard.org</a>.\u00a0 </em></strong></p>",

The process is not easy, but it is most definitely worth it.</em></p><p><strong>What Does the CMP Entail?</strong></p><p>The objectives of the CMP are many and include:</p><ol>\n<li>Complying with and improving USAID\u2019s reporting to the IATI standard and advancing aid transparency commitments;</li>\n<li>Streamlining and institutionalizing USAID\u2019s quarterly reporting to IATI in order to improve data quality and efficiency;</li>\n<li>Fully complying, to the extent possible, with ForeignAssistance.gov reporting elaborated in the Office of Management and Budget Bulletin 12-01; and</li>\n<li>Increasing USAID\u2019s ranking in <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\">Publish What You Fund\u2019s</a> annual <a href=\"http://ati.publishwhatyoufund.org/\">Aid Transparency Index</a>.</li>\n</ol><p>The CMP is also broken down into four phases, which reflect a gradual, step-by-step approach to compliance, and cover all aspects of the publication process: political, technical and systems-related.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Phase One</strong> was implemented while the CMP was still in development. This phase improved USAID\u2019s reporting on 15 IATI data elements, increasing USAID\u2019s reporting to cover 54 percent of IATI data elements including providing links to organizational level files and reporting additional fields such as conditions, type of finance, and status of the activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase Two</strong> will add or improve data on seven IATI elements including links to impact appraisals, evaluations, and in-language activity titles and descriptions. It will also streamline reporting by replacing the existing manual and labour-intensive spreadsheet-based system with an automated process for assembling IATI data. This is expected to create time savings for the extraction of data, and will increase USAID\u2019s reporting to include 64 percent of IATI data elements.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase Three </strong>will add or improve data on four IATI indicators that show sub-national geographic data, objectives, contact details, and activity websites, and improve the management of the redaction process that ensures protection of sensitive information. It will also result in USAID producing its own XML reporting files, and will increase USAID\u2019s reporting to include 70 percent of IATI data elements.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase Four, which was not approved but deferred, </strong>will add or improve reporting on eight IATI indicators that include results, latitude/longitude coordinates, tenders, and policy markers. These will result in USAID publishing 81 percent of IATI data elements \u2013 the maximum level of compliance possible to continue to adhere to privacy laws. In this phase, USAID will modify corporate systems and reporting processes to provide more comprehensive data. Phase Four is deferred, pending work on a new internal information solution.</li>\n</ul><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_3457\" style=\"width: 460px\"><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screenshot.png\"><img alt=\"Source: USAID IATI Cost Management Plan\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-3457\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screenshot-450x300.png\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screenshot-450x300.png 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screenshot-600x400.png 600w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screenshot.png 606w\" width=\"450\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: USAID IATI Cost Management Plan</p></div><p>For more information, you can reach out to USAID at <a href=\"mailto:aidtransparency@usaid.gov\">aidtransparency@usaid.gov</a>.

Further, in 2014, the<a href=\"http://ati.publishwhatyoufund.org/\"> Aid Transparency Index</a> ranked Romania 39<sup>th</sup> out of 50 bilateral organisations (with a score of 10.6%), despite measures taken to improve communication of results. The unsatisfactory ranking called for decisive action and motivated us to start publishing data to the IATI Standard, and improve our performance.</p><p><strong>What tools and processes did you use to publish to the IATI Standard? </strong></p><p>We published data to the IATI Standard through the EU-DEVFIN database, a tool that promotes transparency in official development assistance (ODA) reporting among EU member states, and contributes to the fulfilment of Busan commitments. The MFA EU-DEVFIN data is based on Romania\u2019s yearly ODA reporting. This tool has not only helped us to enhance the quality of our data \u2013 a precondition for transparency \u2013 but also provided us with a fairly simple method of producing the IATI data, since EU-DEVFIN can convert data into the IATI Standard format.</p><p><strong>What were some of the challenges that you found in publishing data to the IATI Standard, and how did you overcome them? </strong></p><p>The main challenge we encountered was coordinating all the national public institutions to use the EU-DEVFIN reporting system. To manage this efficiently, we organised training and other activities to raise awareness of the importance of the reporting process, and implemented a communication system with each public institution\u2019s contact point.\u00a0 From a technical point of view, the EU-DEVFIN produces some errors when exporting IATI files. Here, the support of the IATI technical team was crucial in taking all the necessary steps for overcoming these errors and publishing our data. We are now in the process of improving EU-DEVFIN and repairing the IATI file export function, to make it smoother for future publication.</p><p><strong>What are the potential benefits that publishing open data will bring to your work? </strong></p><p>Publishing information on aid flows in a common, comparable format adds great value to our activities. First, by helping us to better communicate our results to the general public, since the IATI Standard enables us to publish comparable data that is easier to analyse and is more reliable. Secondly, Romania wishes to be an effective and key player in the international development arena, and publishing open data increases the visibility of our results, at national and international levels. Finally, publishing open data increases citizens\u2019 support and trust in our work: citizens\u2019 support allows us to further improve and consolidate Romania\u2019s development cooperation programme, making our work more effective.</p><p><strong>Do you have any advice for other governments or organisations considering using IATI?</strong></p><p>Our main advice to other governments and organisations is to set IATI publication as a core objective, and plan to deliver it using existing tools, systems and technical processes. EU-DEVFIN can be useful for governments who are considering creating their own databases, as the software is open source and it is able to produce IATI formatted data.</p><p><strong>If your organisation is interested in exploring how to publish data to the IATI Standard, using the EU-DEVFIN database or other technical tools, get in touch with the IATI Technical Team <a href=\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</strong></p>",

We are also keen to continue to develop the standard and encourage more stakeholders to not only publish but use IATI data.</p><p>Cordaid believes that the use of IATI and open data in the international development sector challenges the status quo and demands a paradigm shift in the way all stakeholders work. Through the use of IATI, we all become more accountable and transparent, fostering an environment of cooperation and collaboration. Only then, can we actually address the complex realities in which we work and involve all stakeholders in creating sustainable solutions.</p><p><b>What have been the benefits for Cordaid of opening up data through IATI?</b></p><p>One of the biggest beneficiaries of using IATI and open data in general has been Cordaid itself. IATI has provided us with a project documentation framework which we use for communications, fundraising and programming. We have embedded the use of IATI within the organisation and it has become the standard framework in which we share project information and project knowledge.</p><p>It has also helped us to build a reputation for being a transparent, accountable and data driven organisation that promotes the use of open development throughout its work.

Where possible we provide technical support for our local partners to publish to IATI. We also inform all our stakeholders, be it national governments, local partners or funders, that we will publish project information to IATI.</p><p><b>What do you see as the next step in Cordaid\u2019s work on open data?</b></p><p>Like many organisations, we are looking to better document and record results within the IATI data set and make the information relevant and meaningful. This is, of course, not an easy task and I think many stakeholders are struggling with this aspect at the moment.</p><p>We also want to support and promote other open data initiatives and embed them in our organisational processes, such as <a href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/\">Open Contracting</a>, <a href=\"https://eiti.org/\">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a> (EITI) and <a href=\"http://hxlstandard.org/\">Humanitarian Exchange Language</a> (HXL).</p><p><b>Finally, do you have any advice for other NGOs who are seeking to improve their transparency?</b></p><p>Just start publishing. The more you publish, the more you learn. Don\u2019t be afraid to publish your first project to IATI. Be proud of the work you do, let others see the work you are doing, let your own staff see the work they are doing. Only by starting to publish and becoming more transparent will you improve the IATI process for your own organisation. But most importantly, see open data as a means to an end and not the end in itself. See open data as the tool to achieve something \u2013 as the evidence upon which to make decisions. Use your own data, use other organisations\u2019 data, and if that data is not good enough, encourage them to publish more and support them if you can.</p><p><b>If you\u2019re interested in learning more about how your organisation can become more transparent, publishing to IATI or becoming a member of the initiative, visit the website </b><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net\"><b>www.aidtransparency.net</b></a><b> or contact </b><a href=\"mailto:info@iatistandard.org\"><b>info@iatistandard.org</b></a><b>. </b></p>",

Version 2.01 was <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/steering-committee-approves-version-2-01-of-the-iati-standard\">approved by the Steering Committee</a> in October 2014 including changes to organisation identifiers, the number of mandatory fields and improvements to the reporting of free text fields.</p><p>We asked Horia Sohir Debbiche, IATI and Aidflows Programme Coordinator at the AfDB, about their experience of implementing 2.01.</p><p><strong>Why did AfDB decide to use version 2.01? </strong></p><p>The AfDB has a long standing <a href=\"http://devcooperation.org/2014/10/08/transparency-at-the-heart-of-africas-growth-and-prosperity/\">commitment to transparency</a>, and this includes publishing to IATI. We are always striving to keep this commitment proactive, for example through being one of the first multilateral development banks to <a href=\"http://mapafrica.afdb.org/\">publish geolocation data</a>. For AfDB, IATI is not only about reporting, but also making the data more comparable and user-friendly. The AfDB <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/african-development-bank-publishes-to-iati\">first published</a> to IATI in June 2013 and we wanted to show that it was possible to progress and achieve results quickly. When version 2.01 became available the upgrade was a natural move, opening up new opportunities and enabling us to enhance the quality of our data.</p><p><strong>What was the transition process like?</strong></p><p>The process was quite easy, with clear steps to be followed: updating templates, adding new mapping, and deleting unnecessary elements. We used the <a href=\"http://validator.iatistandard.org/\">IATI validator tool</a> to make sure that we had covered all the issues, and were in regular consultation with the <a href=\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\">IATI technical team</a> for advice and support.</p><p><strong>What were the greatest challenges, and how did you overcome them?</strong></p><p>One of the greatest challenges was to get all the team on board. To ensure this, we collaborated extensively with our IT team to ensure we all understood exactly what had to be added, deleted and reordered. Another more specific challenge for us was upgrading the <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/location/\">geocoded data</a>, as we were starting from version 1.03 for this part of the Standard. Again, support from <a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/\">Development Gateway</a> and the IATI technical team allowed us to deal with more complicated issues.</p><p>Being amongst the first publishers to upgrade to version 2.01, we did face some challenges, as it was somewhat a journey of discovery. However, great collaboration both internally and externally allowed for a smooth process.</p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_3384\" style=\"width: 558px\"><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Map-Africa-Screenshot.jpg\"><img alt=\"Map Africa Screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-3384 \" height=\"323\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Map-Africa-Screenshot-450x265.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Map-Africa-Screenshot-450x265.jpg 450w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Map-Africa-Screenshot-600x353.jpg 600w, https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Map-Africa-Screenshot.jpg 1042w\" width=\"548\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">MapAfrica \u2013 the AfDB\u2019s interactive platform that maps the location of their investments</p></div><p><strong>What would you say is the greatest advantage of this version compared to prior versions?</strong></p><p>2.01 adds more rigour to the Standard and allows publishers to provide better quality data. Certain fields are now available that better contextualise and enrich the data, and using codes for some elements makes language more neutral. Overall this means that data is more comparable and, leading on from that, more user-friendly.</p><p><strong>Do you have any advice for other publishers considering the transition to 2.01?</strong></p><p>Transitioning to the new version is just part of the process of publishing to IATI. All the <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/201/upgrades/integer-upgrade-to-2-01/2-01-headlines/\">guidance is available online </a>and the IATI technical team is always available to advise and look at your data. The IATI validator tool is also important, as you can check whether your data files are valid against the <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/201/schema/\">2.01 schema</a>. If you are currently publishing using versions 1.04 or 1.05, it is really just a matter of redefining the template you use and doing a new mapping to the updated standard.</p><p>As publishers of IATI data, we need to make data easier to use and compare for users. As a key step in enabling users to gain more from IATI data, all publishers should move towards upgrading to 2.01.</p><p><em>If you are interested in upgrading to version 2.01 of the IATI Standard and would like some support, get in touch with the IATI Technical Team </em><a href=\"mailto:support@iatistandard.org\"><em>support@iatistandard.org</em></a></p>",

The availability of open data through IATI is now beginning to demonstrate its impact at country level, and countries such as Ghana and Rwanda promote IATI as a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d for data on development finance. In Ghana it supports the effective reallocation of development funds by identifying under-funded sectors. In Rwanda it also supports alignment of development cooperation with country priorities and promotes country ownership of the development process. Furthermore, transparency initiatives that focus on open budgets and open contracting are opening up information at national level, enabling increased participation and accountability.</p><p>This side event, co-hosted by IATI, UNDP, Publish What You Fund, Transparency International and the International Budget Partnership, brought participants together in New York on 19 June to discuss how the FfD outcome can accelerate efforts to improve the quality, comparability, availability and coordination of information through enhanced transparency and use of open data.</p>",

The report has dedicated <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chapter-9.pdf\">chapter 9</a> to the role of better data and information to improve humanitarian response, and goes into detail about the role of IATI stating that \u201cto best meet needs and most effectively direct humanitarian assistance, all those involved in both giving and spending need to know what other resources are at work and where. This is not the case just in preparedness and transitional contexts but also in acute crises.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The report discusses how data reported to the IATI demonstrates the potential of full traceability of humanitarian funding, as well as timely and forward looking data on actual and planned expenditure.

Today, <strong>Marc Schublin, Director of Corporate Responsibility for the European Investment Bank</strong>, describes how the EIB publishes timely data to IATI.</em></p><p>As the EU Bank, the European Investment Bank lends annually around EUR 7bn for public and private sector investment in developing countries outside the EU. Our investments support private sector growth, the shift towards low-carbon, climate-resilient pathways, and the development of strategic infrastructure. These all contribute to poverty alleviation and economic revitalization.</p><p>We have decided to join IATI as we are convinced about the benefits that transparency can bring to aid and development finance and how openness can help in achieving global development objectives.</p><p>Publishing to IATI has made us consider how we can better present our data and projects on our website, and how we can interlink the different online tools that contain project information and documents. IATI has also played a positive role in data quality and general awareness about transparency among our staff. The number of downloads of our IATI files has also increased constantly since we started publishing, which demonstrates that our data is being used and our operations have thus become more visible.</p><p>The EIB is both a bank and a public body. Given this dual character, being transparent about how we make decisions, work and implement EU policies strengthens our credibility and accountability to citizens. Transparency also contributes to increasing the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of our operations, reinforcing our zero-tolerance stance on fraud and corruption, ensuring adherence to environmental and social standards linked to financed projects, and promoting accountability and good governance.</p><p>We have just reviewed our transparency policy, following an extensive public consultation process. Our new Policy continues to commit us to the highest standards of transparency in our day-to-day work and now also includes a specific reference to IATI.</p><p><img alt=\"EIB_EU_SLOGAN_A_French_4c\" class=\"alignright wp-image-3280\" height=\"154\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EIB-logo-450x201.jpg\" width=\"331\"/>As a financial institution that often works with private sector clients in a development context, the EIB has a different business model and way of operating compared to traditional aid agencies. The biggest challenge we faced was the fact that IATI and the reporting standard were initially not designed for our type of institution. Before publishing, therefore, we worked very closely with the IATI Secretariat and a group of other development finance institutions to put in place guidelines specifically for organizations within the financial sector.</p><p>In parallel and internally, we prepared the ground from a technical point of view, setting up the necessary systems, assessing data availability and defining the related procedures for publishing.</p><p>Our signing up and publishing to IATI has been received very positively across the board by our partners and stakeholders. It has also enhanced our cooperation with other institutions in the EU family on issues regarding development transparency. We have already been asked for advice by a number of fellow financial institutions that also work with private sector clients in development, and that are interested in associating themselves with IATI.</p><p>IATI publication cannot be achieved overnight. There are up-front resources needed, transparency does not come for free, and one needs people and systems to have something like IATI successfully up and running. But this investment pays off in the long run \u2013 after only half a year of IATI publication we can already see that IATI reporting can be very cost-efficient. We have deliberately decided to automate our IATI publication as much as possible, which allows us to reduce the workload to a minimum.</p><p>We considered the publication of timely data of key importance from the very beginning. Accordingly, we have educated our staff that the data they put into our systems will appear online shortly after, without any manual changes. Automating this process has helped us in making updated IATI data available on a monthly basis.</p><p>We hope that IATI will continue to be open and flexible concerning non-traditional actors in development cooperation. The landscape of development finance is changing, and an initiative like IATI can play an important role in allowing different types of stakeholders to associate themselves with the global openness and transparency agenda.</p><p>We would also like to see increased usage of IATI data by partner countries.</p>",

In this guest blog, <strong>Smita Biswas</strong>, Head of Monitoring and Evaluation for PIDG, tells why publishing to IATI \u2018reaffirms and reflects PIDG\u2019s commitment to enhance transparency about its activities\u2019. </em></p><p>The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) mobilises private sector investment in infrastructure to boost economic development and poverty reduction.</p><p>All PIDG funding is provided by our Members: nine government development agencies and the World Bank through the IFC. Their funds are invested via a group of subsidiary companies which offer customized specialist financing and project development expertise to get infrastructure initiatives off the ground.</p><p>Our investments are targeted at some of the poorest countries and most fragile states in the world and are expected to deliver significant development impact \u2013 for example, mobilizing investment, improving access to infrastructure, and creating jobs. Being able to demonstrate the impact of our investments and the projects they support has always been important to PIDG and our Members.</p><p>PIDG monitoring and evaluation systems are continuously evolving to set and reflect best practice, and results are published on our website. Publishing on the IATI Registry is another important means by which we can demonstrate PIDG\u2019s ongoing commitment to transparency and accountability.</p><p>When we began our journey towards IATI-compliant reporting 18 months ago, we realized that PIDG, like other similar DFIs and IFIs working extensively with private sector counterparts, had different business models and practices as compared to traditional development cooperation and grant aid providers. Rather than proceeding on the basis of individual exclusion policies, a group of DFIs (including PIDG), led by IATI\u2019s Technical Team at Development Initiatives, worked together to arrive at a common understanding of how we could publish to IATI. This has resulted in PIDG publishing our first IATI-compliant reporting to the IATI Registry: we are committed to publishing and updating our information on a quarterly basis.</p><p>We believe that IATI makes it easier for our Members taxpayers to see how we have utilized funds and the projects that have been supported. Publishing to the IATI Registry reaffirms and reflects PIDG\u2019s commitment to enhance transparency about its activities, improve development effectiveness, promote good governance and build public confidence.</p>",

We welcome the interest in IATI, and would like to follow up on a couple of questions raised during the discussion.</p><p><strong>Q: Why is [IATI] a top down process, why isn\u2019t this lead by the beneficiaries from the bottom up?</strong></p><p>A: The process of developing IATI started by consulting stakeholders in partner countries about the information they need on development cooperation. Representatives of over 70 partner countries confirmed their priority need for timely, up-to-date, and reliable data \u2013 data on where, when, by whom, how, on what, and in which sectors development cooperation is spent. They stressed the need for better information to allow them to monitor results and the impact of aid, and they wanted better coverage. The consultations also confirmed that many different people wanted data for many different purposes, and concluded that it would be impossible for a single database to meet all of these individual needs.</p><p><strong>Q: IATI is supposed to help with accountability, but project descriptions are usually in English, how are local communities supposed to disseminate this information?</strong></p><p>A: At this stage, we are working on growing the list of IATI members and publishers, and helping people to understand better the benefits of IATI. Information on IATI is available <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/resources/speakers-kit\">here</a> on our website in English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Russian.</p>",

The recently launched <a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/index.html\">IATI Dashboard</a> shows how timely and forward-looking publishers\u2019 datasets are, while improvements in 2015 will allow users to delve deeper into considerations of coverage and comprehensiveness. <a href=\"http://d-portal.org/\">d-portal</a> looks at IATI data from the viewpoint of the recipient country, allowing users to drill down to individual project detail and see what data exists, who has published and who hasn\u2019t yet, and where there are data quality issues. All these efforts take us further towards providing the best information to the government ministries, programme managers and ordinary citizens who rely on quality data for optimal planning.</p><p>The year also brings the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in July. <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IATI-and-FFD.pdf\">We\u2019ve already shown</a> that the IATI Standard is flexible enough to capture data on many different types of international development finance flows and, with further adaptation, can provide a means of publishing data on all international development finance flows.</p><p>With all this at hand, we at the IATI Secretariat see 2015 as a year of reckoning \u2013 a time to walk the talk in making development activity as open, transparent and trackable as current technology and resources will allow. We\u2019re excited by the possibilities of the year ahead: by the prospect of swelling ranks of development actors keen to honour their commitments to data transparency by year\u2019s end; by the chance to hear from partner countries whether these efforts are yielding good results \u2013 and where we can do better; and by the opportunity to help spur a quantum leap forward in development effectiveness around the world.</p><p>Join us. <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/201/guidance/\">Publish to IATI</a>, early and often. Make sure the <a href=\"http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/data_quality.html\">data quality</a> is up to par. And if you want to see <a href=\"http://iatiregistry.org/using-iati-data\">what can be done with IATI data</a> \u2013 or come up with some ideas of your own \u2013 get inspired <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news\">here</a>.</p>",

IATI and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Initiatives</a>\u00a0set it up\u00a0with the aim of allowing people in developing countries to view IATI information from their own country\u2019s perspective.</p><p>Nearly 300 organisations currently publish data on their activities to the <a href=\"http://www.iatiregistry.org/\">IATI registry</a> \u2013 d-portal transforms this machine-readable data into information for humans to understand. It shows you all published IATI data from the point of view of a recipient country or a publisher, and gives you the chance to drill down to individual project detail. Users can see what data exists, who has published and who hasn\u2019t yet, and where there are data quality issues.</p><h3><strong>What does the d-portal generator do?</strong></h3><p>There is a huge amount of interesting information within IATI (and therefore, d-portal) and significant value in being able to share bite-size pieces of it freely on other websites and blogs. The d-portal generator allows users to select specific information from d-portal and embed it directly into their own website code.</p><h3><strong>How do you use the generator?</strong></h3><p>There are lots of combinations and possibilities of what to choose when selecting from the vast amount of data in d-portal, so we tried to make the process as simple as possible\u2026</p><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"549\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gen-front-page.jpg\" width=\"977\"/></p><p><strong>1 \u2013 Choose a\u00a0combination of Publisher(s) and Recipient(s) information you want to see</strong></p><p><strong>2 \u2013 Select how you want to display it (a map, table, list, pie chart, etc)</strong></p><p><strong>3 \u2013 Select a colour scheme and re-size the width if required</strong></p><p>Once you\u2019ve completed steps 1 &amp; 2 (3 is optional), you\u2019ll see some code appear automatically in the white box, and an example of your selected content below that box (as below). You then just need to copy the code and paste it into the code of your website or blog post, to embed the content you\u2019ve generated.</p><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"551\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GAVI-screen.jpg\" width=\"698\"/></p><p>Here\u2019s the <strong>live</strong> example of the content which we\u2019ve chosen, and embedded into this page:</p><p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?country=KE&amp;publisher=47122&amp;#view=frame&amp;frame=publisher_sectors&amp;size=550\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 202px;\"></iframe></p><p>Once you\u2019ve embedded any content it will update automatically (overnight) as publishers\u2019 data is updated in the IATI registry.

Without high-quality data providing the right information on the right things at the right time, designing, monitoring and evaluating effective policies becomes almost impossible</em>.\u201d</p><p>The IATI Secretariat welcomes the emphasis in the recent Independent Expert Advisory Group\u2019s report on the importance of global standards and principles to underpin the data revolution. In its first recommendation, the IEAG calls for the development of a global consensus on principles and standards: <em>\u201cThe disparate worlds of public, private and civil society data and statistics providers need to be urgently brought together to build trust and confidence among data users. We propose that the UN establish a process whereby key stakeholders create a \u201cGlobal Consensus on Data\u201d, to adopt principles concerning legal, technical, privacy, geospatial and statistical standards which, among other things, will facilitate openness and information exchange and promote and protect human rights.\u201d </em></p><p>As a UN-led, multi-stakeholder initiative that has already developed a global open data standard for the publication of information on development cooperation, IATI can make a valuable contribution to this effort.</p><p>Many of the key issues identified in the IEAG report are ones that IATI seeks to address, such as ensuring data quality, usability and timeliness. As the report notes, <em>\u201cGood data are relevant, accurate, timely, accessible, comparable and produced free of political\u00a0interferences.\u201d </em>IATI\u2019s learning and experience over the past six years could provide useful insights for future work on this agenda.</p><p>The report further recognises that <em>\u201c[c]omparability and standardisation are crucial as they allow data from different sources or time periods to be combined, and the more data can be combined, the more useful they are\u201d. </em>This, too, is very much in line with IATI\u2019s vision.</p><p>But while global standards can play an important role in helping to guide quality and direction, it is <em>\u201cstrengthening national capacities that will be the essential test of any data revolution\u201d,</em> as the report acknowledges. The same is true for IATI: its ultimate success will be judged on its ability to provide decision-makers at national and sub-national level with the timely, comprehensive and forward-looking data they need on development cooperation to make well-informed decisions, as well as the information required by others to hold those decision-makers to account.</p><p>The real gains will be achieved when IATI data can be easily combined with national-level data to maximise impact \u2013 for example, with regard to capturing results. As this <a href=\"http://devinit.org/donors-results-iati-data-revolution/\">blog</a> from IATI\u2019s Technical Lead sets out, <em>\u201c[i]f top-down data on inputs and outputs from development activities could be joined up with bottom-up impact data collected through the national statistical system, development effectiveness would take a great leap forward.\u201d </em></p><p>All IATI stakeholders have an important contribution to make towards a true data revolution for sustainable development. Donors can geo-code data on their activities to the IATI Standard and release structured data on their outputs; partner countries can invest in improved data collection by national statistics systems; and civil society should continue to demand high-quality open data, and use it to hold decision-makers accountable.</p>",

She noted that how you deliver transparency matters \u2013 if everyone does transparency in their own way, it\u2019s not that useful. Common standards offer more value because they help data use.</p><p>Robin Uyterlinde, Chair of the IATI Steering Committee, gave a brief overview of the initiative, and emphasised that it was designed to meet the needs of users of information, rather than providers. He outlined the multi-stakeholder nature of IATI, and the range of different actors <a href=\"http://www.iatiregistry.org\" target=\"_blank\">publishing</a> to the IATI <a href=\"http://www.iatistandard.org\" target=\"_blank\">Standard</a>. Like other workshop participants, he noted that the absence of data from emerging donors left gaps at country level, where users wanted to build a complete picture of the resources available. He emphasised that while the IATI Standard has a solid core, it also has flexibility to accommodate the different needs\u00a0 of different actors. He said that IATI was keen to work with any emerging donors who are interested in engaging with us.</p><p>From <a href=\"http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?country=MG&amp;tongue=eng#view=main\" target=\"_blank\">Madagascar</a>, Zefania Romalahy spoke about his county\u2019s efforts to encourage donors to provide information for their AIMS, which is available online. This information is vital in reporting back to citizens on who provides development cooperation and what it is spent on. It is important to have information from emerging actors in the same dashboard in order to present a complete picture. He noted that not all South-South Cooperation can be quantified, and this creates a challenge \u2013 existing mechanisms may need to be adapted to deal with this.</p><p>As a concrete outcome of the round table, IATI proposed a technical workshop to explore how existing tools and technologies like IATI could be adapted to capture the contributions of emerging actors.</p>",

The report demonstrates that IATI is truly a multi-stakeholder movement and is gaining momentum.</p><p>The provision of better quality data can enable developing country governments receiving development cooperation to make more informed decisions on budgeting and resource allocation, thus increasing the impact of their own resources as well as those from donors.</p><p>In her foreword to the report, <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">UNDP</a> Administrator Helen Clark says, \u201cThe work of IATI is highly relevant in the context of the deliberations on the post-2015 development agenda, where the issues of accountability and governance are central components. Among the 1.8 million people who have shared their priorities and perspectives in the UN-led consultations on the agenda, one of the most consistent and strong messages is the desire for better governance. IATI is well placed to make an important contribution to these discussions.\u201d.</p><p>Key highlights include:</p><ul>\n<li>In 2013, we\u00a0supported more than 109 new organisations\u00a0to publish data to the Standard, almost doubling the total number of publishers by the end of the year. Many of the new publishers represent international, regional and national NGOs, philanthropic foundations and academic, training and research organisations, as well as the first private sector companies.</li>\n<li>We\u00a0welcomed five new members: <a href=\"https://www.adaptation-fund.org/\">The Adaptation Fund</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bond.org.uk/\">Bond,</a> the <a href=\"http://www.eib.org/\">European Investment Bank (EIB)</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.thegef.org/gef/\">Global Environment Facility (GEF)</a>.

The Development Tracker uses IATI data, making it easier to compare between countries, incorporate data from other IATI publishers, and trace aid through the delivery chain.</li>\n<li>The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (<a href=\"http://www.sida.se/english/\" target=\"_blank\">Sida</a>) launched a new <a href=\"http://www.openaid.se/\">public aid tracker</a>. The tracker uses only IATI data for all core visualisations.</li>\n<li>The IATI <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/secretariat\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Secretariat\">Secretariat</a> also took part in negotiations to define the first <a href=\"http://effectivecooperation.org/\">transparency indicator</a> as part of the <a href=\"http://effectivecooperation.org/about-monitoringframework.html\">Global Partnership Monitoring Framework</a>, and subsequently assisted the joint <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">UNDP</a>\u2013<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OECD</a> support team to pilot the indicator.</li>\n<li>Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have also made notable progress to publish to IATI.

A working group has been established to work on integrating humanitarian needs into the <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IATI Standard</a> in order to provide up-to-date information for humanitarian decision-making and planning for emergency response.</li>\n</ul><p>While IATI has reached critical mass in terms of membership and growth in publishers and has made progress, the message is clear \u2013 it is now important to improve the quality of data and ensure that it can be used to add value at country level.</p><p>In concluding her foreword, UNDP Administrator Helen Clark says, \u201cI encourage providers of development assistance to redouble their efforts to publish timely, comprehensive, and forward-looking information.

The OGP and the Global Partnership share common interests in supporting CSO engagement, strengthening institutions and promoting open access to information.</p><p>The session explored how these concepts can be applied to development cooperation in order to improve effectiveness in poverty eradication and enhance efforts that are responsive to the true needs of beneficiaries. In this discussion, the role of open data, citizen empowerment and effective institutions was explored with transparency as a common thread, not only on strategy and resource allocation, but also on impact in both donor and recipient countries.</p><p>Key outcomes from the session are as follows:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Publishing good quality data in an open format is essential to development cooperation effectiveness and accountability</strong>:\u00a0The session highlighted that data is a key component of decision-making processes in development cooperation and, therefore, having timely, forward-looking and comprehensive data is crucial to making the right decisions. Access to good quality data that allows stakeholders to monitor how development cooperation is allocated can lead to more effective coordination of efforts and can ensure accountability for donors and beneficiaries.\u00a0 To truly tap into the potential value of data, it is essential that it is published in an open format and made available to citizens in an accessible manner. The widespread availability and use of good quality data can lead to improved development efforts, and can empower governments, donors, and citizens to collaborate towards maximising development impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency is a fundamental basis for enhancing development cooperation</strong>:<b> </b>The discussion conveyed the importance of transparency as a crucial ingredient for dialogue on the effectiveness of development cooperation. The session focused on the need to foster a culture of transparency by ensuring political will, capacity building and incentives to encourage and institutionalise transparency. Furthermore, the session called for a more direct linkage between transparency and development results with a strong focus on documentation. In this regard, the IATI standard serves as a model of how transparency, added to political will, technical capability, and civic engagement can lead to improved development outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>The OGP serves as a valuable space for collaboration between citizens and governments</strong>: Transparency and civic engagement are at the heart of the transition from aid assistance towards development cooperation. The former implies that donors and governments measure, understand and respond to the needs of aid recipients. Development for cooperation should begin from the standpoint that citizens can be active agents of their own development. In this sense, empowering citizens and providing them with access to information is crucial. This is at the heart of the theory of change of OGP; there is no cooperation without co-creation.</li>\n</ol><p>OGP creates a space in which public reformers can sit at the same table in a constructive environment to co-create new ways of resolving public problems. Reformers inside and outside of the government structures need to work together effectively to bring about positive transformations in the lives of citizens around the world.</p><p>Overall, the session acknowledged the need to make development cooperation transparent and accessible to citizens, both from donor countries in terms of distribution, and from beneficiaries on feedback regarding the allocation and impact of development efforts. Transparency, open government and open data are powerful instruments to promote accountability and are essential to building trust and effective collaboration among governments, citizens and international organisations.</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

Lucretia Ciurea, Head of Division, State Chancellery, Republic of Moldova noted that the <a href=\"http://effectivecooperation.org/progress/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Partnership Monitoring Report </a>showed only modest progress, and that critical needs were still unmet at country level. As an example, Moldova only has 65% short-term predictability, only 55% is recorded on budget and medium term predictability is just 40%. Only nine of 26 donor partners publish to IATI and, while <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline.htm\" target=\"_blank\">CRS</a> data is useful for historical data, it does not help with national planning. Moldova wants automated data exchange between IATI and its Aid Management Platform and she emphasised that the quality of the data published is key.</p><p>From Madagascar\u2019s Office of the Prime Minister, Isaora Zefania Romalahy <i>\u00a0</i>reflected that transparency was well-advanced compared with some of the other Busan principles but spoke of the importance of having at least provisional data for the year ahead. In response to a question from <a href=\"http://www.gavialliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GAVI</a> on use of IATI data at country level he explained that, even without an automated feed of IATI data, Madagascar uses the <a href=\"http://www.iatiregistry.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IATI Registry</a> for identifying aid coming into the country that does not flow through the government and for finding data from donors who do not have field offices in country.</p><p>The IATI <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/secretariat\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Secretariat\">Secretariat</a> echoed comments by Moldova among others in emphasising the need to improve data quality to promote greater use of data. The Global Partnership Monitoring Report confirmed that it is possible for donors to publish good quality, timely, comprehensive and forward-looking data as some, such as the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden, are already doing.</p><p>From the platform,\u00a0 Klaus Rudischhauser, Deputy Director General, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/index_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\">EuropeAid</a> said that the EU already publishes details of over 8,000 projects (87% of the total) to IATI, adding that, following the monitoring exercise, the EU had waived its non-disclosure policy with regard to forward-spending.\u00a0 Fuad Albassam, Assistant Director General, <a href=\"http://www.ofid.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OPEC Fund for International Development</a> emphasised OFID\u2019s commitment to transparency whilst reflecting that this is sometimes difficult to achieve.</p><p>From the floor, Judith Randel, Executive Director at\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Initiatives</a> called for IATI\u2019s \u201cpublish once, use often\u201d principle to be applied to other resource flows that support poverty eradication, Monica Asuna from Kenya emphasised the problem of aid not being recorded on budget, while Juanita Olarte Suescun from Colombia urged donors not to forget the commitments made at Accra and Busan \u2013 partner countries are still waiting to receive the information they were promised then.</p><p>The session was rounded off by Samuel Aggrey from Ghana who reflected the points made above, reminding participants that transparency is a shared endeavour and one that the Global Partnership is well-placed to take forward.</p><p>As the HLM gets underway here in Mexico today, IATI will be setting up its stall in the Marketplace where we will be demonstrating <a href=\"http://d-portal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">d-portal</a>, the country tracker developed by IATI and Development Initiatives.

Since the introduction of the IATI Standard, over 200 agencies have begun publishing data on their activities in the common IATI format. With the exception of a pilot study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, however, the increasing richness of this new source of data is yet to be fully exploited.</p><p>At our <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/steering-committee/steering-committee-documents\" title=\"Steering Committee Documents\">October 2013 Steering Committee meeting</a> Partner Countries called for data published through the IATI standard to be made more readily available at country level. This survey is an exercise to review the operational capacity of Aid Information Management Systems around the world and to asses, inter alia, how the automatic exchange of data in IATI format may improve planning processes.</p><p>Participation in this survey is welcomed from the broadest possible range of respondents in order to identify challenges at country level. Based on the issues or best practices identified through this survey, IATI will work with partner countries to eliminate challenges and find solutions that will lead to increased availability and use of IATI data at country level.</p><p>If you would like to participate please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:info@iatistandard.org\">info@iatistandard.org</a> for a link.</p><p>Folder designed by\u00a0<a href=\"http://thenounproject.com/stinamc\">Christina W</a>\u00a0from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thenounproject.com/\">Noun Project</a></p>",

We are a diverse group, with people representing partner countries, national and multilateral donors, foundations, civil society organisations and private sector organisations. Another of our strengths is that we include tech geeks, data and business analysts, comms specialists and policy people, giving us a full appreciation of the production and use of the data. And we care about what we do and are passionate about the potential to transform our world.</p><p>So, how do we build on this wealth of energy and enthusiasm now that we are all back at our day jobs?</p><p>Here are a few concrete steps, based on the sessions we held on <a href=\"https://tag2014.hackpad.com/Improving-the-work-of-the-TAG-fiviZvGpWo0\" title=\"Hackpad record of the improving the work of the TAG session\">improving the work of the TAG</a>:</p><h2>1. Improve our online communities</h2><p>We have a range of online spaces for the TAG, including the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iati-technical\" title=\"IATI TAG mailing list\">mailing list</a>, <a href=\"http://wiki.iatistandard.org/\" title=\"IATI technical wiki\">wiki</a>, <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org\" title=\"IATI Standard documentation\">iatistandard.org</a> and <a href=\"http://support.iatistandard.org/\" title=\"IATI support site\">support.iatistandard.org</a>. For someone new to the community these are confusing, so we want to consolidate and improve these so that people can ask questions, discuss ideas and find peers.</p><p><img alt=\"icon_6677\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2686\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_6677-e1392208105134.png\" width=\"20\"/> <em><strong>How can you help?</strong></em>\u00a0Join the mailing list and share your ideas for how to improve the online communities, or volunteer to curate a community space.</p><h2>2. Meet up IRL (in real life)</h2><p>Communities thrive when people can connect, both online and in person. We want to hold more physical meetups, whether based locally (city/country), or by topic (all geocoders or people with an interest in budget identifiers), or in parallel with existing events (like the <a href=\"http://2014.okfestival.org/\" title=\"OK Festival Berlin\">Open Knowledge Festival in Berlin</a>). Or just where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opengovhulk\" title=\"OPENGOVHULK on Twitter\">@OPENGOVHULK</a> happens to be that week.</p><p><img alt=\"icon_6677\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2686\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_6677-e1392208105134.png\" width=\"20\"/> <em><strong>How can you help?</strong></em> Identify IATI community members in your city or country, set up a community meetup in a cafe or other meeting space. Then share your community events with the worldwide TAG through blog posts or the mailing list.</p><h2>3. Improve our documentation</h2><p>We recognise that the IATI technical documentation can be improved, so that different people (publishers, analysts, end users) can get access to the information they need, and so that whether you are new to IATI or have been working with IATI for years, you can get access to relevant helpful information.</p><p><img alt=\"icon_6677\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2686\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_6677-e1392208105134.png\" width=\"20\"/> <em><strong>How can you help?</strong></em> Volunteer to improve the documentation for one or more key areas \u2013 use the mailing list to let the IATI technical team know what you are willing to improve.</p><h2>4. Establish working groups</h2><p>One of the ways to improve the TAG is to form collaborative working groups on particular topics or themes. That way we can develop ideas, work up proposals or even just collaborate on making a small improvement. Working groups also spread the workload and mean that we can achieve more.</p><p><img alt=\"icon_6677\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2686\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/icon_6677-e1392208105134.png\" width=\"20\"/> <em><strong>How can you help?</strong></em> Volunteer to form a working group, maybe on one of the actions arising from the TAG. Let us know through the mailing list or by contacting the team directly.</p><p>Of course, if you have any further suggestions for how to make the TAG even more effective, do contact me or join the discussion below.</p><p><a href=\"mailto:TAG@iatistandard.org\" target=\"_blank\">TAG@iatistandard.org</a></p><p>Gear designed by <a href=\"http://thenounproject.com/antoniopolonio/\" target=\"_blank\">Antonio Vici\u00e9n Faure</a> from the <a href=\"http://thenounproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Noun Project</a></p>",

Donors will also be able to do their jobs better with transparency data \u2013 informing decisions, making partner collaboration easier, fighting corruption and in being accountable to taxpayers.</p><p>Citizens in both donor and developing countries similarly lack the information they need to hold their governments to account for use of these resources. According to Seth Tekper, Minister of Finance of Ghana, \u201cdeveloping countries face huge challenges in assessing up-to-date information about development assistance and this adversely affects our ability to effectively plan and manage our economic development.\u201d</p><p>IATI aims to address these gaps by making information about development spending easier to access, use and understand. \u201cThe aims and objectives of IATI are in line with the Government of Ghana fiscal policy objectives of strengthening budget processes and financial accounting methods,\u201d said Minister Tekper. \u201cIt is in light of this that Ghana endorsed the IATI and has been an active member to date\u201d.</p><p><strong>Way forward</strong></p><p>IATI\u2019s ability to adjust to the changing development cooperation architecture will be a key challenge in advancing IATI implementation over the next three years. In addition to increasing the use of IATI data, particularly at the country level, IATI\u2019s priorities going forward include improving the standard and expanding its membership.</p><p>IATI will need to incorporate information on broader development finance flows, in addition to official development assistance. This will require deeper engagement with a wide range of providers of development cooperation, particularly emerging economies, foundations, and the private sector.</p><p>On behalf of Development Initiatives<i>,</i> Harpinder Collacott said, \u201cas technical lead for the consortium, our aim is to support more organizations to publish to the IATI standard, to improve the quality of the data that is published, and to promote greater use of IATI data\u201d.</p><p>IATI will equally work to strengthen partnerships with other initiatives around transparency, and to increase convergence towards a single common open standard. A technical team comprised of IATI and OECD-DAC experts has been working to ensure complementarity with the OECD-DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS), and the Forward Spending Survey (FSS) in the common standard.</p><p>These topics will be discussed during the next IATI Steering Committee on 2-3 October, in the new UN City in Copenhagen.</p><p>Jan Mattsson, UNOPS Executive Director said, \u201cI am delighted to welcome members of IATI to Copenhagen in October for the first steering committee meeting with the new Secretariat. Transparency is core to development effectiveness and\u00a0I believe that the broad, inclusive and dynamic nature of IATI will ensure that we expand the membership and further advance the transparency agenda.\u201d</p><p><strong>Publish once, use often</strong></p><p>Launched in 2008, IATI provides a common data format for countries willing to release information about current and future development cooperation spending in a timely, comparable and reliable way. Financial flows, budgets, results, location, timelines and project documents are published into an online repository accessible to all users interested in tracking where, when and how development cooperation is spent.</p><p>More than 170 countries, UN agencies, multilateral banks and NGOs covering 76 percent of official development assistance input their information to IATI, and more than 20 partner countries have endorsed the initiative.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>-ENDS-</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IATI-Welcomes-New-Secretariat-EN.docx\">IATI Welcomes New Secretariat EN</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IATI-Welcomes-New-Secretariat-ES.doc\">IATI Welcomes New Secretariat ES</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IATI-Welcomes-New-Secretariat-FR.doc\">IATI Welcomes New Secretariat FR</a></p><p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p><p>UNDP with its presence in 177 countries brings unparalleled outreach opportunity with all stakeholders and across the UN system. The organization has continually proven its commitment to transparency and adhered to its IATI implementation schedule, recently launching open.undp.org and publishing over US$5.8 billion in project data. UNDP has also been a member of the IATI Secretariat since 2011, supporting pilot initiatives in developing countries to test the benefits of IATI. UNDP will lead the new Secretariat and have overall responsibility for coordination, communications, outreach to partner countries and non-traditional donors, and liaison with the Steering Committee.</p><p>UNOPS demonstrated its commitment to IATI by becoming the first UN institution to publish its information as per the standard in October 2011. It has since supported other UN agencies in their efforts to do so, as well as taking forward the wider transparency agenda, for example, in the area of UN procurement. UNOPS will provide financial management and administrative services, including procurement, collection of membership fees and additional voluntary contributions, disbursement of resources to partners and contract management. UNOPS will also ensure the smooth running of all logistical aspects of the IATI Secretariat, Steering Committee and TAG meetings.</p><p>Ghana was one of the first partner countries to endorse IATI and has been a vocal member of the IATI Steering Committee and the Partner Country Caucus, frequently representing the views of partner countries to the wider group. Ghana\u2019s broader commitment to transparency is clear in the wording of its constitution, its accession to the Africa Peer Review Mechanism and its membership of the Open Government Partnership. Ghana is well placed to galvanise partner countries to engage in the IATI process given its pioneering role in transparent government and its credentials as the host of the Accra High Level Forum-3 as well as the IATI consultative workshop for the West and Central Africa Regions.

To date, DI has provided technical support to 25 IATI signatories in publishing their aid information to the IATI Registry. It was the first NGO to publish to IATI in July 2011 and has since worked with BOND to support 60 UK NGOs plus 12 other non-signatories to publish to IATI. DI will provide technical leadership and support for implementation, and for maintaining and developing the IATI standard.

The larger impact of the Fund may very well be its ability to be flexible and to pioneer initiatives such as:</p><p>1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Market-based resource mobilization:</i> most of the aid architecture for climate finance is through country contributions; the Fund, however, receives revenue from a two per cent levy on emission reductions from the clean development mechanism.

As the devastating effects of climate change become increasingly clear, and attention turns to scaling up climate finance through the long-awaited Green Climate Fund, the experience of the Adaptation Fund is ever more critical. The Fund is keen to share its successes and lessons learned so that the larger community can improve the effectiveness of aid delivery within climate finance generally and with specific attention to climate change adaptation. \u00a0By becoming a signatory to IATI, the Adaptation Fund is confirming its commitment to openness and transparency.</p><div></div><hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/><div>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> While unique, the volatility of the market has led to an unstable revenue stream.

        "content": "<p>NEW YORK \u2013 26 March 2013. A multi-stakeholder consortium has been chosen to host the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), giving new impetus to the drive to increase the transparency and effectiveness of development spending.</p><p>The consortium \u2013 led by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and including the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), the Governments of Ghana and Sweden, and a UK-based NGO Development Initiatives \u2013 was selected by IATI\u2019s Steering Committee in Paris on March 13 following a competitive process. \u00a0Beginning in mid-2013 for a three year period, the consortium will take over the role carried out since 2009 by the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID).</p><p>Developing countries today face huge challenges in accessing up-to-date information about aid, and in planning and managing these resources effectively. Citizens in developing and donor countries similarly lack the information they need to hold their governments to account for use of these resources.</p><p>IATI aims to address these gaps by making information about aid spending easier to access, use and understand.</p><p>Launched in 2008, IATI provides a common data format for donors willing to release information about current and future aid spending in a timely, comparable and reliable way. Financial flows, budgets, results, location, timelines and project documents are published into an online repository accessible to all users interested in tracking where, when and how aid is spent.</p><p>More than 120 UN agencies, multilateral banks, bilateral donors and NGOs covering 76 per cent of official development assistance input their information to IATI, and more than 20 partner countries have endorsed the initiative.</p><p>Each member of the consortium brings a unique set of strengths and all have demonstrated their strong commitment to transparency and the goals of IATI. The consortium approach will ensure that the initiative remains inclusive and dynamic, reflecting the changing development environment of today\u2019s world.</p><p>UNDP will lead the consortium, coordinate the work of the secretariat and use its global network to promote and expand IATI\u2019s effectiveness. UNOPS will provide financial and administrative services. Development Initiatives will support IATI\u2019s Technical Advisory Group and provide technical support to IATI publishers. Ghana will ensure that partner countries are engaged and represented. Sweden will reach out to and engage donor countries.</p><p>IATI\u2019s ability to adjust to the changing aid architecture will be a key challenge in advancing IATI implementation over the next three years. IATI will need to incorporate information on broader development cooperation initiatives, in addition to official development assistance. This will require deeper engagement with a wide range of providers of development cooperation, particularly emerging economies, foundations, and the private sector.</p><p>IATI will work to ensure complementarity with the OECD-DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS), the Forward Spending Survey (FSS) in the common standard and prioritize progressive convergence towards a single common open standard, with all Busan endorsers completing common standard implementation schedules outlining their plans to fully implement this standard by the end of 2015.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Consortium members</span></p><p>UNDP with its presence in 177 countries brings unparalleled outreach opportunity with all stakeholders and across the UN system. Ensuring improved aid effectiveness is fundamental to UNDP\u2019s vision and forms the basis for its work globally. The organisation has continually proven its commitment to transparency and adhered to its IATI implementation schedule, recently launching open.undp.org and publishing over $5.8 billion in project data. UNDP provides Secretariat support to ensure the effective functioning of the Global Partnership. Through this relationship and the Development Cooperation Forum (DCF), UNDP has the opportunity to coordinate efforts between IATI and other initiatives around aid transparency to implement the Global Common Standard on Transparency agreed in Busan.. Playing a key role in the consultations leading to the establishment of the post-2015 agenda, UNDP also sees the opportunity to raise the profile of IATI within that forum. Specifically, UNDP will ensure the consortium is delivering its objectives, coordinate and oversee the administration and financial management of the consortium, lead its outreach and information functions, and provide overall substantive support to IATI Secretariat, TAG and Steering Committee meetings, fundraising efforts, and to the reform of IATI structures.</p><p>UNOPS demonstrated its commitment to IATI by becoming the first UN agency to publish to the standard in October 2011. It has since supported other UN agencies in their efforts to do so, as well as taking forward the wider transparency agenda, for example in the area of UN procurement. UNOPS brings its experience as the legal host to other multi-stakeholder initiatives as well as providing support to other international secretariats, both inside and outside the UN system. UNOPS has strong skills in efficient and cost-effective project management and in creative fundraising. UNOPS will provide financial management and administrative services within the consortium \u2013 including HR, procurement, collecting contributions, disbursing resources to partners and contract management, and ensure the smooth running of all logistical aspects of IATI Secretariat and Steering Committee meetings and other activities.</p><p>Ghana was one of the first partner countries to endorse IATI and has been a vocal member of the IATI Steering Committee and the Partner Country Caucus, frequently representing the views of partner countries to the wider group. Ghana\u2019s broader commitment to transparency is clear in the wording of its constitution, its accession to the Africa Peer Review Mechanism and its membership of the Open Government Partnership. Ghana is well placed to galvanise partner countries to engage in the IATI process given its pioneering role in transparent government and its credentials as the host of the Accra HLF-3 as well as the IATI consultative workshop for the West and Central Africa Regions. Ghana will co-lead the consortium\u2019s engagement and outreach with partner countries alongside UNDP. It will also contribute political leadership to the reform of IATI structures and ensure that the interests of partner countries are fully represented in the management of the initiative.</p><p>Sweden is a founder member of IATI, was one of the first donors to publish to the standard, and was seconded to the IATI Secretariat in the run up to Busan to enhance capacity for political engagement and ensure coordination with the Building Block on Transparency (which it co-chaired with the World Bank). Sweden has also demonstrated its commitment to transparency through the launch of national initiatives such as its aid transparency guarantee and its web-based platform, OpenAid.se, and through its engagement with other global initiatives including the Open Government Partnership, the Open Aid Partnership and the Grand Challenge Making Voices Count. As an acknowledged world leader on transparency, Sweden is well-placed to lead the consortium in its political engagement and outreach to other donors, and to ensure liaison between IATI and other processes such as the Open Government Partnership, the Open Aid Partnership, the OECD-DAC (WP-STAT), the Global Partnership and the Common Standard. It will also provide political leadership to the reform of IATI structures.</p><p>Development Initiatives has been a member of the IATI Secretariat and Steering Committee from the outset, responsible for drafting the initial scoping paper on IATI, helping to shape the IATI standard, with an emphasis on ensuring that the standard meets the needs of stakeholders in partner countries, and managing the development and launch of the IATI Registry. To date, DI has provided technical support to 35 IATI signatories in publishing their aid information to the IATI Registry, was the first CSO to publish to IATI in July 2011 and has since worked with BOND to support 73 UK CSOs plus 12 other non-signatories to publish to IATI. DI\u2019s primary role within the consortium will be the continued provision of technical leadership and support, including the technical support necessary for maintaining the IATI standard, and managing support for implementation. DI will also continue to play a role in outreach, with a specific remit to engage with non-traditional donors (NGOs, foundations and the private sector) whilst supporting other consortium members who lead on other aspects of outreach and engagement.</p><p>\u2014-</p>",

However, instead of pondering the IATI equivalent of \u2018Pipers piping\u2019, \u2018Drummers drumming\u2019 and the ultimate, \u2018partridge in a pear tree\u2019, we thought we\u2019d share some of our reasons to be merry at the close of 2012.</p><p>This is by no means a full report of the many achievements and lessons learned from the past year. Stay tuned for the IATI Annual Report in March 2013 for more detail.</p><p><strong>The leap from 15 to 100 publishers</strong></p><p>A year ago, thirteen IATI signatories and two NGOs had published their data to IATI. This month, UN Women became the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/100-development-organisations-now-publish-through-the-international-aid-transparency-initiative-iati\">100th organisation</a>\u00a0to publish their data to IATI.

New members are:\u00a0 Belgium, Canada (CIDA), CDC, International Labour Organisation (ILO), Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), UN-HABITAT, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UN Women, US Government and World Food Programme (WFP).</p><p><b>22 partner countries</b> have endorsed IATI: Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia, Lebanon, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Moldova, Montenegro, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Syria, Tanzania, and Vietnam.</p><p><strong>Using IATI data \u2013 compliant data at country level</strong></p><p>Recently, IATI, with Development Gateway and Development Initiatives, has successfully piloted automated data exchange between donors\u2019 IATI data feeds and the national aid management system in DRC, the Plateforme de Gestion de l\u2019Aide et des Investissements (PGAI). \u00a0PGAI is now using live IATI data from DFID, The Global Fund and GAVI, with plans to roll this out to other donors including Canada, EC, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and UNDP in the coming months.\u00a0 Similar work in aligning IATI data with national aid information management systems and country budgets is planned in Rwanda and Nepal, while IATI is exploring the scope for integrating data from NGOs and South-South Cooperation providers in aid management systems in Colombia.</p><p>As well as work with government partners, the aidinfo programme is working with civil society partners in Nepal, Kenya and Uganda to improve access and support use of the data being published.</p><p><strong>IATI access and use of data </strong></p><p>It is important to note that it is still very early days for IATI implementation, and as we have seen in other open data initiatives, it takes a little time for a market of tools to emerge. However we are starting to see the ecosystem of use of the data emerge. A number of donors (Netherlands, UK, UN Habitat, UNOPS) have built website applications to visualise their own data, and we are starting to see early versions of some interesting tools that bring all the IATI data together in one place such as AidView.net and <a href=\"http://beta.openaidsearch.org/\">OpenAid</a>. These and other tools are showcased by <a href=\"http://aidinfolabs.org/\">aidinfolabs.org</a>, which promotes new initiatives and provides access to the technical code so it can be reused. It currently has over 20 packages of code.</p><p>However, there is much to do in order to improve the accessibility of data, which highlights several development needs for IATI in 2013. The most significant is development of the <a href=\"http://iatiregistry.org/\">IATI Registry</a> and Data Store to enable easier access to the data. Work is being done in partnership with the <a href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> to provide download of a bespoke extract of data (e.g. all health projects in Ghana) in a format selected by the user.</p><p><strong>Working toward a common standard</strong></p><p>The IATI Secretariat convened a group to define the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/aid-architecture/acommonstandard.htm\">common standard</a> together with representatives of IATI\u2019s multi-stakeholder Steering Committee with representatives of the OECD DAC\u2019s Working Party on Statistics and the leaders of the Busan Building Block on Transparency. Detailed negotiations led to an agreement that was endorsed by the final meeting of the Working Party on Aid Effectiveness (WP-EFF) in June 2012.</p><p>This confirmed that the common standard should work to combine three complementary systems, the DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and Forward Spending Survey (FSS) and IATI. The group has since agreed the common template for an implementation schedule for the common standard.</p><p><strong>What was your stand out IATI moment for 2012?</strong></p><p><strong>Share your stories by emailing me at <a href=\"mailto:kim.borrowdale@devinit.org\">kim.borrowdale@devinit.org</a> or share them with the community on Twitter by using #IATI.</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p>",

And today sees IATI going from strength to strength. Congratulations must go to the 35 IATI signatories and 100 publishers to date. The IATI family has shown that when organisations commit to being more open and accountable, they become more than the sum of their parts.</p><p>But there is still much more to do \u2013 both in terms of increasing the number of publishers and improving data quality. I urge all organisations, big or small, to publish their information to IATI. Only then can development activities be truly effective, efficient and accountable.\u201d</p><p>A full list of publishers can be seen on the <a href=\"http://iatiregistry.org/\">IATI Registry</a>. IATI was launched in Accra, Ghana in 2008<strong> </strong>and seeks to address development data demands by working with donors and implementing partners to make information is available in a consistent, comparable and coordinate way, removing the barriers to empowering informed decision making on aid remain. Users of information need to access the information they need when and where they need it, whether they are citizens of countries receiving aid, donors managing aid budgets,\u00a0 governments and parliamentarians, or civil society organisations.</p><p>The UK was the first government to publish its data through IATI, and it included fully disaggregated transaction reporting and forward-looking activity budgets. Sweden was the first to publish its entire links to activity documentation while the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the first recipient government to start using IATI data. Aside from governments, in the world of NGO\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/\">Global Fund</a> was the first to publish results with <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/\">Oxfam</a> being the first INGO to follow suit. <a href=\"http://www.hewlett.org/\">The Hewlett Foundation</a> was the first foundation to publish through IATI with the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a> being the first multilateral donor organisation to publish.</p><p>While celebrating this important milestone in IATI we also look forward to working with our many partners in the future to broaden and develop the IATI process to encourage transparency in aid data at a global level.</p>",

The upgraded platform has been enriched by a number of new data elements that have been added as part of UNOPS IATI publication.</p><p>UNOPS became an IATI signatory in September 2011 and managed to successfully publish a dataset covering over 1,000 activities to the Registry within a few weeks of joining.\u00a0The speed of publication was applauded by a number of IATI stakeholders and while it is true that the migration of UNOPS data to the IATI format was quick, it was made possible by building on work already achieved by three key internal innovations related to transparency.</p><p>The underlying work began in 2009 as part of an organizational commitment to transparency and three areas were focused on that allowed UNOPS to publish so quickly:</p><p>1) A commitment to improving the structure, storage and quality of basic project data</p><p>2) A centralized and quickly accessible repository of project documentation</p><p>3) A solid integration of transparency-related IT tools into the organisation\u2019s existing internal management systems</p><p>The speed of the initial data clean-up and the deployment of UNOPS original project information platform was made possible by a combination of points one and two.</p><p>The combination of all three made it possible for UNOPS to then quickly add geocoded information to the IATI dataset in what was a very rapid turnaround.</p><p>The new open data hub represents a significant upgrade of UNOPS original project data feed as it now includes information that has been added to UNOPS IATI data.\u00a0This includes geocoded values, OECD-DAC sector codes and in a number of cases, project documents have been made available for download.</p><p>The hub is an alternate manifestation of UNOPS internal enterprise reporting system \u2013 with a radically different user interface or \u201cskin\u201d applied on top. These systems were conceived and designed with openness in mind from the outset.\u00a0There is extensive use of JavaScript, JSON, RESTful web services and SQL (not T-SQL) throughout. Each of the tiers (data, middle and display) have been constructed to run on open source platforms and UNOPS hopes to release the source of the hub, alongside other projects, as open source offerings in the near future.</p><p>Get in touch with the team behind the platform to find out more: <a href=\"mailto:opendata@unops.org\">opendata@unops.org</a></p>",

Their publishing to IATI is not only the first of its kind from North American government, but it is also the first to be done bilingually \u2013 including information in French and English or linking to bilingual code lists on the IATI website. In July 2011, as part of the Government of Canada\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.open.gc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Government</a> initiative, CIDA launched its <a href=\"http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/ACDI-CIDA.nsf/eng/FRA-511112638-L57\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data</a> portal. We can look forward to some exciting visualisations by CIDA, including the possibility of geocoded and mapped data.</p><p>Furthermore, CIDA recently announced its support for the <a href=\"http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/ACDI-CIDA.nsf/eng/NAT-420143919-PVM\" target=\"_blank\">Open Aid Partnership</a> (OAP) which will increase the capacity to produce and use open data in partner countries, and this followed the announcement that Canada had joined the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Government Partnership</a> \u2015 a multilateral initiative to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.</p><p>We look forward to more open data of this kind to be published in the near future.

        "content": "<p><em><em>Kim Borrowdale, IATI Delivery Manager, recently attended Okfest 2012 in Helsinki (Finland) and has shared her personal account of the conference with us</em>. The theme was Open Knowledge in Action with a </em><em>full week</em><em> of participatory sessions, keynote lectures, workshops, hackathons and satellite events organised by diverse communities from over 40 nations across the globe.(</em>Event Summary<em>).</em></p><p><em>The event was divided into topic streams, with one of these, the </em><em>Open Development stream</em><em>, specifically designed to explore how the OKFest community can engage with key development challenges.</em></p><p><em>Over to you Kim\u2026.</em></p><p>Just about every session at OKFest was live streamed with delegates sending in presentations, photos, videos and feedback to the OKFestival team as I type. As everything you could possibly need from the festival will be available to you over the next couple of weeks, I won\u2019t bore you with a long list of all of the sessions I attended, or wish I had attended. Instead, I\u2019d like to share my top five takeaways.</p><p>(Apologies to speakers in advance for any poetic license I may have unwittingly taken from ear to notepad):</p><ol>\n<li><strong>\u201cOpen development looks very different depending on where you sit in the global development process\u201d</strong> \u2013 Blane Harvey, OKFest panel member from Institute of Development Studies</li>\n</ol><p>The very first session in the Open development Topic stream was all about defining what we mean when we say open development.</p><p>While we all agree that open development is a good thing and is something we should be working towards, there is no real guide for the community as to how to work more openly. We\u2019ve spent many years talking about open data, but open development is so much more than that. During the discussion at this session it was clear that we needed a \u201cparticipatory process\u201d, \u201cone that is more horizontal than top down\u201d, and that empowers citizens to claim their role in deciding and managing development processes.</p><p>Openness doesn\u2019t just mean making things publicly available, but is about involving all actors in the process. But, what does this mean in practice?</p><p>Philip Thigo from The Social Development Network (Kenya) made an interesting point about the language used in the development community.\u00a0 In open development, words and phrases like \u2018the developing world\u2019 etc. would not be used as citizens would be part of the process rather than recipients. If open is an \u2018attitude\u2019, how does our tone of voice need to change? This needs to be more than just a concept. We need to take concrete steps to get to open development.\u00a0 John Adams from DfID (Department for International Development) used IATI as an example of something that started as a political commitment to transparency, and, with firm actions, has developed into the IATI Standard and clear steps for implementation. What are the steps we need to take to move open development from a concept into a working infrastructure?</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Trying to explain Open Development? Open for Change launched a great video at OKfest to help you do just that \u2013 <a href=\"http://openforchange.info/\">Watch it here</a></p><ol>\n<li><strong>\u201c</strong><strong>Knowing is not enough. We must apply. Willing is not enough. We must do.\u201d</strong> \u2013 Bruce Lee via <a href=\"http://www.aidinfo.org/about-us/team/simon-parrish\">Simon Parrish</a> from aidinfo</li>\n</ol><p>Putting aside the entertainment value of seeing Bruce Lee on an IATI presentation slide, this quote sums up the point \u00a0a number of speakers were making in relation to good intentions and developing robust solutions over time versus getting on with it and learning and adapting as we go.</p><p>We have seen this in the IATI community. Yes, we have structures in place to change our approach more formally when needed, but this should not slow the pace of those leading the way in opening up their development data. What we have learned is that it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, get it out there to the community so it can be used, refined, and developed.</p><p>Michael Edson made some interesting points on this subject, in his keynote speech <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/edsonm/michael-edson-lego-beowulf-and-the-web-of-hands-and-hearts-for-the-danish-national-museum-awards\">\u2018Lego, Beowulf and the Web of Hands and Hearts\u2019</a>, as part of the Open Cultural Heritage topic stream,. As Director of of Web and New Media Strategy at the Smithsonian Institution, he has seen museum websites go from the authoritative voice to one of many on the web, often far down the list behind YouTube, Wikipedia and community discussion forums.\u00a0 If we continue with the mind-set that we need to plan and perfect over months and months before publishing, we will get left behind \u2013 \u201cStop thinking about it and do it \u2013 Don\u2019t talk about what you want to do, just do it. Mock it up and talk very fast\u201d.</p><p><strong>WARNING:</strong> You may become addicted to Googling lego re-enactments of historical events after watching Michael\u2019s keynote speech.</p><ol>\n<li><strong>\u201cGet to the exciting stuff. I\u2019m so bored by the basics, there is so much more we can do!\u201d</strong> \u2013 IATI Technical Advisory Group member (possibly overheard at the pub)</li>\n</ol><p>Now I\u2019m pretty sure this was a reference to IATI (International Aid Transparency Initiative) and the elements currently required (link). I\u2019m not sure where I heard the comment but I was struck by this point. Yes! Why are we limiting ourselves to some kind of common standard that is a mere minimum?! We should do more; push the limits of the data we seek out on behalf of partner countries.</p><p>This was even clearer after attending several IATI workshops. The development community is an ambitious one, constantly asking each other what this means at grass roots level. However, what is also clear from these sessions is that when it comes to understanding what it means to be transparent, all actors in the development space are at different places on the transparency spectrum \u2013 and it involves so much more than just picking and choosing the data to make available. There are policy and process conversations to be had including short, medium and long term technology and resource plans to be made.</p><p>We currently have <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/about/whos-involved\">82 IATI publishers</a> and plan to report on their compliance to the IATI Standard and future implementation plans early in 2013. While many have made outstanding progress since committing to IATI, I think it would be fair to say that not one of the publishers has a perfect scorecard just yet. As each organisation finds it way in this increasingly transparent world, we should remind ourselves that complying with standards like IATI is not where effort ends. It is just laying solid (accessible and comparable) foundations for being able to \u201cget to the exciting stuff\u201d.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Delegates who attended the IATI workshop for NGOs found it useful when Joni Hillman from <a href=\"http://www.bond.org.uk/\">BOND</a> and Rolf Kleef from <a href=\"https://partos.nl/\">PARTOS</a> talked them through the IATI five point plan for compliance. This approach may be useful for your organisation \u2013 find a copy <a href=\"http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/20648592-the-five-steps-to-becoming-iati-compliant\">here</a></p><ol>\n<li><strong>\u201cWhat about my mother in a small village, with no phone, no internet and no English?\u201d</strong> \u2013 came up in just about every session but I think I heard John Ndungu from iLabAfrica say it first</li>\n</ol><p>When you have a lot of people who are passionate about data, technology and development, it is easy to get caught up in finding the best technical solution and drill down to the detailed data requirements needed for that solution.</p><p>But, at the Africa Labs session in particular, it was evident that whatever the question that needs answering, the solution will need to be a combination of communication channels, from cutting edge to traditional, depending on the end user. Yes, we need ways to show data that is accessible to those who rely heavily on the internet. These are often important internal engagement tools for organisations and governments needing to progress the commitment to transparency, as well as influencing and decision tools for those working directly on projects and programmes in country. But, what about John\u2019s mother in the village? How will we know what information she needs and what format will be most palpable for her?</p><p>There were some great reminders at OKfest about the importance of including traditional channels of communication such as community radio and print media. There was also recognition of increased mobile and smartphone use but some limited knowledge of the features of such \u2013 perhaps text messaging or voicemail should be considered as well as mobile responsive design of web tools?</p><p>And, once you determine the right channels to give access to information, what is relevant to each recipient? While we can \u2018type\u2019 communities according to the communication channels most relevant to them, we cannot assume that within this grouping that each individual is seeking out the same information for the same reasons.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Use videos to help stakeholders in your organisation understand the different perspectives and challenges in partner countries. During the Africa Lab, our friends from El Salvador showed a <a href=\"http://ht.ly/dWfrz\">video</a> that was very effective in showing how even people with similar social circumstances are often coming from completely different perspectives in terms of the information they want to access.</p><ol>\n<li><strong>\u201cWho knew they are trying to do the same stuff as us in the museum world?\u201d</strong> \u2013 Me, as I sat in on one of the Cultural Heritage topic stream lectures</li>\n</ol><p>In one of the sessions in the Open Cultural Heritage topic stream, Neelie Kroes, Vice President of the European Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda gave a virtual address, highlighting the European Commission\u2019s commitment to policies, projects and funding to support open data and open access, including for public sector information, cultural data, science and research.</p><p>What was interesting to me is that we in the development community have a similar agenda to those in other sectors \u2013 from museums and culture to science and universities. We are looking to open up access to information in order to inform future decisions and direction. What have we learned with open data and work on IATI that could help other sectors in taking practical steps to transparency? And, most importantly for us, what are lessons have those learned in other sectors that could help progress the open development agenda?</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Think about your friends in different sectors. Have they made progress in opening up their knowledge where you haven\u2019t? Or perhaps they can give you a different perspective on how to communicate. Make time for a coffee with someone outside your sector.</p><p><strong>Find out more</strong></p><p>For detail on the lectures, workshops, hack sessions and much more, keep an eye on the <a href=\"http://okfestival.org/\">OKFestival website</a>.

We\u2019re really pleased to be taking this important step in our journey to become a more open and transparent organisation.</p><p>We\u2019ve also launched the <a href=\"http://open.unhabitat.org/\">Open UN-Habitat</a> website which will be the focal point for our open data and transparency work over the coming months and years. The site launches with six projects, but over the next few weeks we will be adding more.</p><p>The technology behind the site is all open source. We worked with the Dutch nonprofit Akvo and their <a href=\"http://oipa.openaidsearch.org/api/v2/docs/\">OIPA tool</a> to index the IATI data. OIPA is a search tool built in Django which enables IATI compliant datasets to be easily parsed and was developed by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/siemvaessen\">Siem Vaessen</a>. The front end was built by Kenyan web agency <a href=\"http://www.verviant.com/\">Verviant</a> in WordPress. All the technology we used is available under a Creative Commons license <a href=\"https://github.com/openaid-IATI/OPEN-UN-HABITAT\">on Github</a>.</p><p>During phase one of the transparency initiative we will add projects approved since 1 January 2012. The aim is then to add all projects that we are currently involved in delivering. The process of backdating will take some time but we hope that it will be completed during 2013.</p><p>We see this as a work in progress and the site is currently in \u2018beta\u2019. Our starting point is to publish as much data as we can, but for an organisation the size of UN-Habitat this will take time. The first big priorities will be to publish the data that we already have, and automate the process of IATI reporting. Once that is in place, we will focus on improving data quality and improving reporting processes. We would also like to make the data more useful by doing sub-national geocoding, providing transaction level information on fund commitments and disbursements and publishing monitoring and evaluation reports.</p><p>If you have any comments or thoughts, we would love <a href=\"http://open.unhabitat.org/contact/\">to hear them</a>.</p><p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Alternatively contact me directly on\u00a0<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">pontus.westerberg@unhabitat.org</span></span></p>",

This highlighted the number of IATI publishers who still have a lot of work to do on improving their data \u2013 something we are working on with them, this month and next, as part of a data review.</p><p>I thought it might be useful to share what we are encouraging publishers to consider when reviewing and revising their data. From an IATI perspective, we define \u2018quality\u2019 data in three parts:</p><ol>\n<li>Core project details updated in timely manner(quarterly): ID, title &amp; descriptions, dates, country, participating(implementing) orgs, sectors, commitments / total project budgets</li>\n<li>Fit for purpose for purpose for country-level aid co-ordination, and aligning aid with country budgets: meaningful unit of aid; full history of project financial data, disaggregated and timely transactions, project forward looking budgets for at least next year</li>\n<li>\u2018Added value\u2019 elements requested by partner countries: subnational geo data, project docs, results, traceability (incoming source), country budget for three year, whether it is on/off budget.</li>\n</ol><p>These aren\u2019t yet formal criteria, but we hope to use them for the IATI annual report due to be published early 2013 \u2013 a draft will go to steering committee in November.</p><p>Another part of the data review process for IATI publishers is to look at how they are publishing information and the validity of the format of their data\u00a0 rather than just the content. Often we\u2019ve found that data will \u2018fail\u2019 a compliance check due to simple technical formatting issues, something we are addressing with individual publishers as we talk through the detail of the data review.</p><p>Thanks to all who attended DDC 2012 for the work you\u2019ve done to progress the IATI compliance tool, and in highlighting what we also rate as the number one priority for IATI publishers, data quality.</p><p>We\u2019d love to hear from you if you have any other IATI lessons learned from DDC. Members of our team will also be attending OKfest in September, so <a href=\"mailto:Kim.borrowdale@devinit.org\">get in touch</a> if you\u2019d like to find out more about IATI fringe events or arrange to meet up.</p><p><strong>Kim Borrowdale, IATI Delivery Manager</strong></p><p><strong>Kim.Borrowdale@devinit.org</strong><strong></strong></p>",

Four<strong> Civil Society Organisations</strong> have already published data\u2014Oxfam, Development Initiatives Poverty Research, Engineers Without Borders Canada and the International HIV/AIDS Alliance. One additional foundation (Indigo Trust) has also published.</p><p>Those publishing so far provide some <strong>42% of Official Development Assistance and Other Official Flows</strong> (average for 2008-09), with information from the Hewlett Foundation, the Indigo Trust, UNOPS and four CSOs being additional to this. Once all existing signatories publish their information this figure will increase to 64%. Previously stated interest from Canada and the US in aligning with the IATI standard would bring the coverage up to 80%.</p><p>This rush to publish demonstrates strong commitment to increased transparency as the foundation for improved aid effectiveness, and firm support for the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as the means of delivery. By publishing their aid information to IATI\u2019s common, open standard, these organisations are ensuring that their data can be used, compared and re-purposed to meet many different needs.</p><p>The range of information published to IATI by these donors, and others, will grow over time, increasing its usefulness to stakeholders in partner countries.</p><p>To view the data, visit the <a href=\"http://www.iatiregistry.org/\">IATI registry</a>.

To address this issue they state that aid flows and tracking systems need to be more transparent for both parties.</p><p>As a way of achieving this, they are looking toward a common standard for publishing aid information, stating that they will:</p><blockquote><p>collectively support the adoption of IATI or an IATI-compatible standard.</p></blockquote><p>To get this process underway for those Commonwealth member states not yet involved, they will release a timetable of when and how they plan to adopt these standards.</p><p>Ministers recognised their role in ensuring that aid is effectively used and the importance of greater aid transparency efforts. To this end, in addition to asking donors states to adopt the IATI standard, Commonwealth member parter countries have called on donors to:</p><blockquote><p>fast-track the implementation of key components needed to deliver on aid effectiveness commitments including publishing information on results, conditions, activity-level budgets and future flows: to explore how best to include non-ODA flows in IATI, including the rapid integration of climate finance into IATI; and to ensure that contractors employed by donors use IATI.</p></blockquote><p>The Commonwealth Secretary General, Kamalesh Sharma, emphasised the large role that Commonwealth countries play in global aid flows, stating:</p><blockquote><p>The Commonwealth currently occupies a central and influential position in global aid flows with a large number of members comprising aid recipients and a growing number as aid donors. Commonwealth members of the Development Action Committee (DAC) of the OECD provide annual aid exceeding $23 billion while aid received by Commonwealth developing countries aggregates some $28 billion.\u00a0 Our members account for 18 per cent of global ODA disbursements and 22 per cent of receipts from DAC donors.</p></blockquote><p>We really welcome this positive development.

Josh is an associate at Development Gateway, working on AidData\u2019s geocoding initiatives. </em></p><p>Publishing sub-national geographic project locations has the potential to greatly increase the transparency of donor activities.\u00a0 In addition to the required IATI fields including sector, funding, and implementation date, IATI contains an optional section on sub-national geographic data, tying project-level information to locations at the city or administrative level.</p><p>For IATI signatories that want to geocode their activities, this means tracking the site location(s) for each project.\u00a0 There are just a few key pieces of information needed: the latitude and longitude, the relevant country and governing administrative districts for that location, and a <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/codelists/geographical_precision\">precision code</a> to indicate the level of geographic specificity (ranging from \u201cexact location\u201d, such as a populated place or a hill, to \u201cunclear\u201d, in which case the project is classified as \u201cnational\u201d and linked to the country\u2019s capital city).\u00a0 There are a number of other optional fields, but those required create sufficient data to enable a great deal of analysis (and nice maps that can be mashed up with development indicators, or maps of other activities).</p><p>To date, two IATI signatories have pursued a large-scale geocoding program: the <a href=\"http://maps.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/\">African Development Bank</a>.\u00a0 Using the geocoding methodology developed by Uppsala University and <a href=\"http://www.aiddata.org/\">AidData</a> \u2013 available at <a href=\"http://open.aiddata.org/content/index/geocoding\">open.aiddata.org</a> \u2013 both donors have generated geographic data that meet the optional IATI standards.</p><p>Once donors provide sub-national geographic information in the standard IATI format, it will be possible for civil society, policymakers, and researchers to visualize aid distribution at a district or provincial level, as well as access site-level information for ongoing aid projects.\u00a0 As Aleem Walji of the World Bank has said, this information could be used to fuel feedback loops along the lines of a <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2011/04/20/world-bank-map/\">\u201dYelp for government.\u201d</a> Using site-level information, aid beneficiaries in a given city or town would be able to provide feedback on project implementation and usefulness, identify waste, and hold donors and governments accountable.\u00a0 Combining geographic location with other IATI fields related to funding levels, project dates, and activity specifications will serve to strengthen and inform this feedback, helping to move IATI from transparency to impact.</p>",

The first hosted by the UK and attended by the EC, Global Fund, the Netherlands and Sweden, and the second hosted by the World Bank and attended by Canada, the Foundation Center, the Hewlett Foundation, UNDP and USAID.</p><p>Both workshops were an opportunity for those organisations in the process of implementing or planning implementation to meet together and share lessons and challenges from their own experiences.</p><p>All organisations highlighted the importance of incremental approaches to transparency and publishing open data. Initially publishing what you can, with a commitment to complying to the standard at a later date is a valid and useful method for publishing aid data in accordance to the standard.</p><p>Other areas of discussion included:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Change management and communications</strong>: raising awareness of transparency in an organisation and the explaining the impact of the change process to all members of staff;</li>\n<li><strong>Data quality</strong>: when to start the data quality process in the project cycle, and integrating it into existing processes;</li>\n<li><strong>Governance structures and managing implementation: </strong>structuring IATI implementation like a standard IT project and forming working groups;</li>\n<li><strong>Using IATI data</strong>: how providers of data can collaborate with those using it, in order to create useful tools and ideas for improving data;</li>\n<li><strong>Technical architecture: </strong>what organisations have currently got in place and how it can be adapted and changed to fit with IATI implementation;</li>\n</ul><p>For more information on implementation and to start or join any discussions about any topics around implementation, visit the\u00a0<a href=\"http://support.iatistandard.org/home\">support forum</a> on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iatistandard.org/\">IATI Standard website</a>.

Almost a third of the 35 implementing countries are now complying with their standard, and momentum is impressive.</p><p>There are some lessons and points of comparison with IATI:</p><ul>\n<li>Like IATI, the EITI is a multi-stakeholder initiative, bringing together representatives from government, private companies and civil society. This approach has enabled the initiative to gather strong support from all sectors, facilitating swift movement forward.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Currently the EITI standard does not request specific disclosure of revenue flows from individual countries, allowing some parties to provide only aggregate figures. At the Conference, Radhika Sarin of Publish What You Pay and the EITI International Secretariat stressed the importance of providing more disaggregated data in future, in addition to increasing the transparency and availability of information about extractive licenses and contracts.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>The Revenue Watch Institute have done some interesting work on analysing current EITI reports and creating visualisations of data to explain trends (see their analysis <a href=\"http://data.revenuewatch.org/eiti/\">here</a>). EITI are considering how to promote accountability at a local level. Obiageli Ezekwesili, Vice President for Africa at the World Bank, opened the session on using EITI data and discussed the importance of making data useful and accessible, cutting through a \u201cmumbo jumbo of numbers\u201d.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>A communications strategy is an integral part of countries implementing the EITI. They have produced <a href=\"http://eiti.org/document/communicationsguide\">this useful document</a> to support implementers and compliers with their communications efforts.</li>\n</ul><p>It is useful to see a transparency initiative that is several years older than IATI in operation, and to consider how some of the lessons learned from EITI\u2019s experience might be applicable to IATI.

The DPAF provides a joint tool for the monitoring of donor performance against their national-level and international commitments on the volume and quality of development assistance provided to Rwanda. As such, the DPAF indicators are drawn from the Paris Declaration indicators.</p><p>The DPAF is presented both in aggregate form (comprising all development assistance to Rwanda) and disaggregated by donor to allow for comparison, individual reflection on performance, as well as accountability and peer pressure, which are recognized as key ingredients to the successful implementation of the Paris Declaration and Rwanda\u2019s Aid Policy at the country level.</p><h3><strong>Process and results</strong></h3><p>The first DPAF was published in 2009, which assessed the performance of the 2008 fiscal year. The 2009/10 DPAF was undertaken through the Development Assistance Database (DAD), which accommodates the DPAF module. This has led to improved aid information recorded in the Development Assistance Database in terms of quality and volume.</p><p>The DPAF FY 2009/2010 results indicate that there has been an improvement at aggregate level in a number of indicators. However, most of the indicators did not meet the targets set for FY 2009/2010 or the Paris Declaration (PD) Target 2010, despite the considerable efforts made by some DPs who showed incredible transformation of their ODA portfolio in the last 1-2 years.</p><p>This year\u2019s DPAF oriented the discussions during the 9<sup>th</sup> Government of Rwanda and Development Partners Meeting (DPM) which took place on 4-5 November, 2010. The DPM focused on how DPs can fully channel external financing through country systems and in-year and medium term predictability of aid resources. As an outcome of the DPM, all the official Development Partners agreed to use Rwanda country systems, including treasury, reporting, procurement and auditing systems. They also agreed to communicate monthly projection of disbursements as opposed to quarterly disbursement which posed planning problems, this will enhance transparency and accountability.</p>",

A glossary of formal definitions is also being prepared for consultation with members and a guide for users of IATI data is in the pipeline. A support package, including site visits, is being prepared to assist those donors committed to implementing IATI this year.

The IATI Registry is also in development and a trial version will be published in October.</p><h2>Preparing for Phase Two and beyond</h2><p>The next TAG workshop takes place in October and consultation papers on a range of topics are in preparation. Outstanding issues include organisation identifiers, multi-funded activities, related activities, total activity costs, budget alignment, geocoding, aid effectiveness indicators, outputs and results, conditionality, budgets and planned disbursements, project documentation. If you have not been approached and are interested in contributing to the work on any of these issues your contribution will be most welcome.</p><p>The October Workshop will also be an important milestone in advancing the work on Licensing and the Framework for Implementation (previously known as the Code of Conduct) as both these workstreams are due to be completed by the end of the year.</p>",

This paper provides a tool for assessing the costs and benefits of increased aid transparency, with particular reference to the potential costs and benefits of implementing the emerging proposals of the International Aid Transparency Initiative.It attempts to quantify the administrative cost to each donor of implementing IATI, the potential efficiency savings for both donors and recipient countries, and the resulting gains in aid effectiveness.</p><p>The paper concludes that while there will be variations between donors, the efficiency savings of implementing IATI are likely to pay for the transitional cost within a year or two. While the effectiveness gains are more uncertain, the paper concludes that even on the most conservative estimates, the benefits of greater aid transparency vastly outweigh the estimated costs. The Steering Committee endorsed the proposed framework at its April meeting and confirmed that no further work is required by the Secretariat, since the paper provides sufficient information and analytical framework for individual donors to conduct their own cost-benefit appraisals should they wish to do so.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Local commitments to aid transparency: the Kinshasa Agenda</strong></p><p>The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and its development partners signed a pact on implementing the Paris Declaration principles back in June 2009 and only a few years after the resumption of structural assistance to the country in 2002. <span id=\"more-868\"></span>The agreement known as <a href=\"http://www.aideffectiveness.org/Country/RD-Congo/Forum-sur-l-efficacit%C3%A9-de-l-aide.-Agenda-de-Kinshasa.html\">the Kinshasa Agenda</a> has two chapters: one on affirming the Government\u2019s leadership in setting the aid policy dialogue and managing aid and a second one on implementation of key public sector reforms and capacity development support. Both chapters have specific provisions in relation to aid transparency:</p><ul>\n<li>Donors agree to provide information on their assistance before the end of the year (i.e. 2009) and the Government undertakes to include it in the 2010 budget (para. 6);</li>\n<li>Donors and the Government agree to further use the aid information management system put in place by the Ministry of Plan called Platform for the Management of Aid and Investments (PGAI \u2013 French acronym) and to strengthen the capacities of the local management team (para. 13).</li>\n</ul><p>Since then, the Ministry of Plan has made significant progress in the collection of information from donors in an environment where aid represents an important share of GNI (according to the OECD the net ODA/GNI ratio was 15.6% in 2008[1]) and for the most part is provided off budget. While a major public financial reform is underway, which will improve the budget-execution system and strengthen the overall budget culture, the Ministry of Plan is in discussions with development partners on a follow-up agreement to the Kinshasa Agenda, i.e. <strong>a Code of Conduct</strong>, that will define the scope of information to be provided to the PGAI by donors, NGOs and line ministries; the regularity of the updates and the way the information will be used. The objectives are to set the expectations straight, further streamline the reporting/validation processes, but also to ensure that the quality of information in the system effectively supports national planning and budgeting.\u00a0 In this regard, the Ministry of Budget is keen on using the PGAI for the budget process and needs information on actual and planned disbursements, which is submitted in line with the national budget cycle. For the majority of development partners, meeting this requirement is feasible and a number of them are already doing so. According to Yvon Mombong, Coordinator of the PGAI <em>\u201cdonors are willing to provide information, but are often not available when it comes to entering data into the system or updating it\u201d.</em> Staff turnover, time constraints and other priorities take over. The hope is that the future Code of Conduct will become a viable tool, underpinning the Kinshasa Agenda and the public financial reform efforts in the DRC.</p><hr size=\"1\"/><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Source: <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/31/1901167.gif</a>.</p>",

Unfortunately no partner countries had commented by the deadline.</p><p>The consultation remains open at <a href=\"http://www.iaticonsultation.org/\">www.iaticonsultation.org</a> for those who still wish to comment. Online consultation enables us to process feedback as efficiently as possible and allows all participants to view comments made by others. The proposals on the scope of IATI are accompanied by specific proposals from the TAG on common definitions and data format that were discussed by the TAG at its meeting on 22 and 23 March (see <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/tag-meeting-record-22-and-23-march-2010-final.doc\">record</a> of that meeting). They include existing codes lists (via hyperlinks on the site) that we propose should form the core of the IATI standard taxonomy, on which we can subsequently build.</p><p>The comments welcomed the greater level of precision about the proposals and, with a couple of exceptions, that they build on existing reporting standards. But as the deadline of reporting on phase\u00a01 by the end of 2010 approaches, donors are cautioning about changes they will need to make to their systems and the difficulty of reporting monthly and in more detail. Some question the inclusion of a few data elements or seek more information and/or to postpone some items to a later phase. All continue to have problems with providing budgets and planned disbursements 3 to 5 years ahead.\u00a0 CSOs wish to see the momentum maintained, faster progress on items such as conditionality, and information on the outcome of procurement.</p><p>The TAG Secretariat is now reviewing the comments and will invite comment between 4<sup> </sup>June and 11\u00a0June on any major issues (with a one week lag for\u00a0French and Spanish versions). We will circulate a revised version of the proposals, with recommendations where choices need to be made, on 23 June prior to a meeting of the all signatories, Steering Committee\u00a0members and endorsers of IATI in Paris on <strong>7 July, to agree final, detailed proposals for data.</strong></p><p>Implementation of IATI will be phased, increasingly helping to meet commitments made in the Accra Agenda for Action. The consultation document outlines the proposed phasing of publication for each category of information. We have sent a donor assessment questionnaire to signatories and observers seeking information about any flexibility they require within the overall phasing for staged implementation. The content and timing of the phases is as follows:</p><p>Phase one \u2013 end of 2010</p><p>This will lay the foundations for IATI. It focuses on more timely publication of data that are already captured by donor systems plus interim advice on linking documents that are already in the public domain to IATI. Phase one will also provide some high-level information on future aid flows, in total and for contributions to major international institutions.</p><p>Phase two \u2013 September 2011 \u2013 prior to the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness.</p><p>This proposes to expand the range of existing information by publishing data that are routinely collected by donors\u2019 internal systems, such as project contacts, beneficiaries and budgets, as well as information on conditions and future aid flows at country-budget level. It will link the published data to the economic, sectoral, functional and administrative classifications used by recipient country budgets.</p><p>Phase three \u2013 end of 2012</p><p>This proposes to further expand the range of data and documents published to include some categories of information that are not routinely collected by donor systems and will therefore require more substantial amendments to existing systems, e.g. detailed geographic information, output and outcome indicators and results indicators.</p><p>During the second half of 2010, we will do further work on part four of the IATI standard\u2014the code of conduct\u2014and on publication of documents and the remaining data items. We will present proposals for consultation in October and November.</p><p>We encourage everyone to comment. This is your chance to shape IATI!</p>",

        "content": "<p>In January the Secretariat published a new paper outlining how IATI can offer added value to existing aid reporting systems without disproportionate cost to donors.  The paper,<a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Implementing-IATI-Jan-2010-v2.pdf\"> Implementing IATI: Practical Proposals</a> argues that rather than just improving existing databases, IATI should extend the range of aid information that is made available, including documents as well as data, and make it quick and easy for users to find.<span id=\"more-559\"></span></p><p>Secretariat member Carolyn Culey explains how the system would work:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cDonors would use their existing internal systems for collecting aid information.\u00a0 But they would include additional information needed by other stakeholders and publish the information more rapidly, and in a common electronic format. They would then register the location of their information in an IATI Registry \u2013 a kind of online catalogue that would enable users to locate it.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The paper notes that many different users want access to aid information for many different purposes, and no single database can satisfactorily meet all of those diverse needs.  It says that donors are currently engaged in duplicate reporting, for example providing information to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) databases and to many individual country-based Aid Information Management Systems (AIMS), as well as responding to ad hoc requests for aid information.</p><p>\u201cThe IATI approach can be summarised as \u2018publish once, use often\u2019\u201d says Calolyn Culey. \u201cIt will reduce duplicate reporting by allowing donors to assemble their aid information once, in a way that would meet existing internal and external reporting requirements, at the same time as responding to the demand for additional information.\u201d</p><p>The proposals are designed to minimise the additional burden and maximum benefits of aid transparency by ensuring that information, once collected, is universally accessible.</p><p>Click here to view the  a copy of the full study  <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Implementing-IATI-Jan-2010-v2.pdf\">Implementing IATI: Practical Proposals.</a></p>",
